            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Secondly, in reſpect of my dutie vnto your Honour. And firſt in reſpect of the cauſe, the Sabbath being a principall meanes whereby the ſeede of religion is ſowen in our hearts, and the holie fire as it were is kept in amongst vs. It being aſſailed by aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of diuers ſorts, to whom ſhould it flee as vnto a Sanctuarie for ſuccour, rather than vnto your Honor? who haue alreadie taken home vnto your honourable familie the truth, like as the beloued Diſciple did the <note place="margin">

Yea being your Honor haue not alone taken home the truth, but alſo publiquely in the higheſt and ſolemneſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie of this land vndertaken the maintenance and the defence of the ſame truth againſt the common aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie the Papiſt.

And this in reſpect of the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Now in reſpect of my ſelfe alſo I could doe no leſſe: for being imbarked in that ſhip, whereof your Lordſhip vnder the Kings moſt excellent Maieſtie as the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Pilot holdeth the helme, I meane your Lordſhips garriſon towne of <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> and ſucceeding others

            </p>
            <p>By theſe reaſons therefore (right Honourable) I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lead, haue preſumed to approach ſo neere vnto your Honour, as to put foorth theſe my labours vnder the liuerie of your honourable fauour. Wherein although there be nothing anſwerable vnto your greatnes, yet if, as the finger ſerueth to point vnto the Sunne, and the iuyce of a Limmon to ingraue aſwell as <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> ſo this may ſerue to point vnto that which I would, but cannot attaine vnto ſufficiently to make knowne your Honours worthineſſe, and ſomething to expreſſe the thankfulnes of my heart, I wanting better meanes to vtter it, I ſhall thinke my ſelfe not to haue attained the loweſt degree of happineſſe in my low eſtate.</p>

In regard of which ſlacknes of ours, he vſeth foure reaſons, all of great moment to perſwade vs. And firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knoweth that nothing will perſwade ſo well with vs as a benefit: therefore in the firſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> place he vſeth this argument of his bountie; <hi>he giues thee ſixe daies to keepe one:</hi> where if he ſhould

Secondly, leſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> thou ſhouldeſt doubt of the equitie thereof, he ſheweth thee what right he hath vnto it, in that he ſaith it is his Sabbath: <hi>It is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> And wilt thou then withhold the right from the owners thereof? Prou. 3. 27. Or, as the Apoſtle reaſoneth, ſhall I take the members of Chriſt, and make them the members of an har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot: ſo, wilt thou take the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, and make it the Diuels Sabbath? which if thou keepeſt not vnto the Lord, thou keepeſt vnto the Diuel; as the Idolaters that ſacrificed vnto their Idols, ſacrificed vnto the Diuels, 1.

And firſt of the Sabbath day, or day of reſt (that I may bee vnderſtood of what reſt I intreate.) <note place="margin">How many ſorts of Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths there were amongſt the Iewes.</note> We are to conſider, that amongſt the Iewes there were two kinds of Sabbaths: one of yeeres, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of daies. That of yeeres was euery ſeuenth yeere, in which they might not ſowe their land, but let it reſt: or euery ſeuen times ſeuen yeeres, which was the yeere of Iubile: in which bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men went out free, and alienated poſſeſſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned againe vnto the owners, Leuit. 25. 10. Of theſe Sabbath of yeeres we intend in this place no further diſcourſe, we come therfore vnto that other part of the diuiſion, namely the Sabbath of daies. And here againe I muſt diſtinguiſh: for the Sabbath of daies was alſo two-fold; ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and morall. Now of the firſt ſort were all the Sabbaths that were inſtituted by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ceremoniall law: ſuch as were the Paſſeouer, Pentecoſt, the new Moone, and the feaſt of Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacles;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:20637:11"/> which, Leuit. 23. are called Sabbaths. Of the ſecond ſort, which wee call morall, is that Sabbath which is commanded in the Decalogue or tenne Commandements: of which here in this treatiſe our purpoſe is to write.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>2</label> Now betwixt this morall Sabbath (which we ſo call, becauſe it is a part of that law which gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth inſtruction for manners) and theſe other ceremoniall Sabbaths, there is great difference, which <hi>Moſes</hi> Leuit. 23. 37, 38 pointeth at: where <note place="margin">The differe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce betwixt the morall and the ceremoniall Sabbaths.</note> hauing ſpoken before in the chapter both of this Sabbath and of thoſe feaſts before named, hee concludeth his ſpeech of the feaſts thus: <hi>Theſe are</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the feasts of the Lord, which ye ſhall call holy conuocations, &amp;c. beſides the Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> that is, beſides thoſe Sabbaths which they were to keep euery ſeuenth day. Now the difference was: Firſt, this morall Sabbath <hi>God himſelfe ſpake it immediatly,</hi> Exod. 20. 1. <hi>and afterwards writ it in tables of ſtone with his owne finger,</hi> Deut. 9. 10. and therefore Exod. 32. 16. theſe tables are ſaid to be <hi>the worke of God,</hi> and this writing to be <hi>the writing of God ingrauen in the tables.</hi> And this he writ not once, but when the tables were broken, he wrote in the ſecond time, Exod. 34. 1. And leſt any man ſhould ſay, that God alſo ſpake and writ the reſt when <hi>Moſes</hi> Deut. 5. 22. had rehearſed the tenne Commandements vnto the Iſraelites, he addeth that <hi>all theſe words God ſpake, and added no more, but wrote them vpon two tables,</hi> and when he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them, as appeareth Deut. 4. 13, 14. hee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>Moſes</hi> at the ſame time <hi>that he ſhould teach</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:20637:11"/> 
                     <hi>them ordinances and lawes, which they ſhould obſerue in the land which they went to poſſeſſe.</hi> So that this is manifeſt that the Decalogue or tenne words was only ſpoken and written by God; but all the reſt added by <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is the firſt difference. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, this morall Sabbath was more ancient. For it had his inſtitution, as appeareth Gen. 2. 2, the very next day after mans creation: yea and his obſeruation together with his inſtitution: for God himſelfe reſted vpon it, where as thoſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall Sabbaths tooke their beginning but from <hi>Moſes.</hi> Thirdly, it was alſo more holy: for where as vpon this day it was not lawfull for the Iewes to dreſſe their meate, Exod 16. 23. nor to kindle a fire, Exod. 35. 3. vpon theſe ceremoniall Sabbaths, it was permitted vnto them to doe it, Exod. 12. 16. And laſtly, it was more durable: for the couenant of the moral Sabbath was an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting couenant, Exod. 31. 16. as alſo ſhall anon further appeare: whereas the other was but a vaniſhing ſhadow, and to laſt but vnto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of Chriſt: for it was foretold by <hi>Daniel,</hi> that the Meſſiah ſhould cauſe the ſacrifice to ceaſe, Dan. 9. 27. And that the Iewes knew well enough, in that <hi>Iohn</hi> being demaunded by them what he was, and denying that he was either the Chriſt, or <hi>Elias,</hi> or any of the Prophets. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded again of him why he did then baptize: thereby intimating y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vnles he were one of theſe, he might chaunge nothing in the Law: wherin they ſecretly graunted that theſe might doe it. And as the Meſſiah had authoritie in himſelfe to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20637:12"/> change the ceremoniall law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo might he alſo change theſe ceremoniall Sabbaths; they being a part of that law which was ceremoniall; which alſo hee did. And therefore ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Let no man condemne you in reſpect of an holie day, or of the new Moone, or of the Sabbaths: which were but a ſhadow of things to come, namely of our eternall reſt in heauen, which wee obtaine by faith in Chriſt. Which Sabbath the Iewes thought did ſhadow out on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly their reſt in Canaan: but the Apoſtle Heb. 4. verſ. 8. confuteth them, for (ſaith he) if Ieſus (that is <hi>Ioſua)</hi> had giuen them reſt, then <hi>Dauid</hi> would not after that day haue ſpoken of another reſt; ſaying, that <hi>God ſware in his wrath that the vnbelee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſhould not enter into his reſt,</hi> for their vnbeliefe ſake: yet this reſt in heauen remaineth now vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of God, that is, to the beleeuers; although the ſhadowes thereof be done away, the bodie which is Chriſt, being come.</p>

Inſomuch that whither ſoeuer they did caſt their eyes, there was ſomething to teach them. For if they looked vpon their bodies, then circumciſion offered it ſelfe; if vpon the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of their bodies, the fringes taught them; if
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20637:12"/> vpon their tables, there was choiſe of meates; if they came into their houſes, the Law was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vpon the lintles of their doores; if they went into the fields, there were the firſt fruites; if vnto their flockes, there were the firſt borne to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed; if they brought foorth children, then the firſt begotten; if they thought vpon the times, there were alſo remembrances for them. In the week, the ſeuenth day; in the moneth, the firſt day; and in the yeere the ſeuenth, and the fiftith were to be kept holy: but if they came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Temple, then the ſhadowes were in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber without number, there was the Altar, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, the vaile, the mercie ſeate, and a number ſuch like which did moſt liuelie ſhadowe out Chriſt vnto them. For in all theſe ceremonies <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote of him, Ioh. 5. 46. but now all theſe ſhadowes are ended: for the bodie which is Chriſt is come. And hee hath taken them away, and therefore now wee muſt not any more bee lead as children, but as men of a riper age. For if wee ſhould yet hold theſe things, it were to bee feared that the Apoſtles and Miniſters of the Goſpell that haue troden in their footings, had beſtowed their labour vpon vs in vaine, Galat. 4. Theſe feaſts therefore and ceremoniall rites, and ritely ceremonies, the date of them being out long agoe, the writings razed, and the ſeales can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled; we intend not to ſpend any longer time in the ſuruey of them.</p>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20637:13"/> Sabbaths to intreate of that Sabbath which is morall: which is here commanded in the Decalogue to be kept holy. For of this only is mention made in this place, and not of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sabbaths. Therefore the Lord ſaith, <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbath,</hi> ſpeaking of one: and not, <hi>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Sabbaths,</hi> as intending to eſtabliſh and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate many by his commaund.

In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede I confeſſe that the other Sabbaths were here by a figure called <hi>Synecdoche</hi> incluſiuelie commaunded, ſo long as the ceremoniall law continued: euen as in the ſecond commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were alſo commanded all the ceremonies in Gods outward worſhip, ſo long as the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law was to continue: but when there was another kinde of outward worſhip inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the former fell away; and yet the ſecond commaundement continued a laſting precept euen vnto vs for euer: ſo alſo might theſe cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall Sabbaths, for the time they laſted, bee here in the fourth precept commaunded: and yet when the ceremonies were to haue an end, they were to determine with the ceremonies: the commaundement notwithſtanding to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine for euer; and as effectually and fully to commaund theſe other times that ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be appointed by Chriſt or his Apoſtles in the ſteede of the Sabbaths, as euer it did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the former.</p>

Now that it is here commanded, and is a part of this morall law, I thinke no man will be ſo blunt to denie. And that this law is perpetuall, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, firſt in that it is the ſame with the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is written in the hearts of all men. For <note place="margin">The morall law the ſame with the law of nature.</note> what elſe is the law of nature, but a diuine rule written in the hearts of all men, more or leſſe, by God himſelfe; by which they know in generall what is good, and what is euill. Now that this law is the very ſelfe ſame with it, who ſeeth not? Only there is this difference, that the one is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in ſtone as well as in the harts of men: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the other is onely written in the ſtonie hearts of men: which difference is onely in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but as touching the ſubſtance they are all one. And therefore the Apoſtle Rom. 4. 14. ſaith, that <hi>the Gentiles which were without the law,</hi> (vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, written in ſtone) <hi>yet did by nature the things contained in the law, which</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>ſhewed the effect</hi> or ſentence <hi>of the law written in their hearts.</hi> Which he proueth by the working of their own conſciences, that did both <hi>excuſe and accuſe them.</hi> And (were it not a thing ſuperfluous in a matter ſo euident, and ſo often done by others) if a man ſhould but a little examine the records and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the ancients, he might find the very ſelfe ſame things with <hi>Moſes</hi> law, written and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Heathens themſelues. And firſt to let
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20637:14"/> paſſe theſe things which wee haue in common with the beaſts, as that euery nature ſeeketh the preſeruation of it ſelfe, and the propagation of it kinde: come wee firſt vnto the firſt table; for if the Heathens were ignorant in any thing, it was in things concerning God. Wherein I confeſſe the law of ſinne after the fall had much ouer growne the law of nature: yet notwithſtanding God would <hi>not</hi> in this <hi>leaue them without testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> Act. 14. 17, to the intent that they might bee without excuſe, as he ſaith Rom. 1. 20: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>that which might be knowne of God, was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vnto them: for God had ſhewed it vnto them,</hi> Rom. 1. 19. And that it was ſo, appeareth in the records that yet are extant, and are alleadged by the Fathers to that purpoſe. And to begin with the very firſt commaundement, which teacheth the true knowledge and inward worſhippe of God. Haue not the Philoſophers themſelues, as <hi>Plato, Pythagoras,</hi> and the reſt, written whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of his nature, attributes, and worſhip? which if a man deſire to know, hee may either reade in their own writings, or find them vrged to that purpoſe by the Fathers that had this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie with the Heathen that knew not God. And for the ſecond commaundement, let <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> by name teſtifie what he thought of it: who, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> witneſſeth in his life, would not ſo much as ſuffer an image in Rome to be erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. For (ſaith he) being that God is an inuiſible ſpirit, hee was not to bee figured by any viſible image. And this was ſo generally receiued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:20637:14"/> them, as that for the ſpace of 170. yeeres there was no image of God erected in Rome. And as touching the third commandement, the name of God was with ſuch religion regarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, as that there were ſome found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, that did chuſe rather to die, than to breake their oath, as <hi>Regulus:</hi> which alſo their lawes yet extant againſt periuries and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, doe ſufficiently teſtifie: which, were they in force amongſt vs, wee ſhould not haue oathes ſo rife as now they are, euen as our ſteps, or as the ſtones of the ſtreetes: or if we had, yet we ſhould haue law to puniſh the blaſphemer, wheras now we haue none: but of this ſufficient. There re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth onely the fourth commandement, that a time, all buſineſſe ſet apart, is to be ſanctified to Gods ſeruice. Wherein let their <hi>Feriae</hi> and <hi>dies feſti,</hi> that is, their holy daies and daies of reſt from labour, teſtifie that they held a time, all buſineſſe ſet apart, to be kept holy vnto the Lord. Now as for the ſecond table I hope I ſhall not be put vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to much buſineſſe in it, ſeeing the Philoſophers intreate moſt of the duties commanded therein; yea they were in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> knowledge therof ſo exact, as that it is poſſible to find amongſt them ſome one precept that containeth in it the effect of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond table: namely, that ſentence which was ſo rife amongſt them: <hi>Quod tibi non vis fieri, alteri ne feceris,</hi> that is, That which thou wouldeſt not haue done to thy ſelfe, that thou ſhalt not doe to another. Now what elſe is this but the ſame with that Matth. 6. which Chriſt calleth the law
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:20637:15"/> and Prophets? <hi>Whatſoeuer</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye would that men ſhould do vnto you, euen ſo doe you vnto them, for this is the law and the Prophets.</hi> So then the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue being the ſame with the law of nature, is one and the ſame for euer. It followeth neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily that the Decalogue is to remaine for euer, and conſequently the Sabbath (being a part of that Decalogue) is to remaine for euer.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>6</label> And to put this matter out of doubt that the Decalogue is to remaine for euer, and is not abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: the Apoſtle himſelf auoucheth it Rom. 3. the laſt verſe, where diſputing of iuſtification by faith, without the workes of the law; he putteth <note place="margin">The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the law warranted by the Apoſtle</note> this queſtion; <hi>Doe wee then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>make the law of none effect?

Now that which is eſtabliſhed is made more ſure, than it was before. And therefore thoſe that ſay the moral law is aboliſhed by the law of faith, ſpeake like <hi>Peter</hi> in the transfiguration, they wote not what they ſay. For the Apoſtle ſaith it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and not aboliſhed by faith.</p>
                  <p>Neither yet is the Apoſtle alone in this caſe; <note place="margin">The law war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted to continue by Chriſt.</note> but he followeth therein the example of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Chriſt, who expreſlie affirmeth ſo much, Matth. 5 17. where ſpeaking of the morall law, he ſaith, <hi>Thinke not that I am come to deſtroy the law or the Prophets, I am not come to deſtroy them but to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill them.</hi> The occaſion of this doctrine, as it ſhould ſeeme was thus, becauſe hee had found fault ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:20637:15"/> times with the Phariſies for their ouer ſtrict keeping of the Sabbath, preferring the reſt of the day before the good of man, as if man had been made for the Sabbath, and not the Sabbath for man, the Phariſies therefore began to accuſe him as a breaker, or rather as an aboliſher of the law: And as it may ſeeme ſome of his Diſciples alſo began to drinke in this opinion and to promiſe libertie vnto themſelues, as if Chriſt had come to put an end vnto the law; eſpecially ſeeing hee went about to eſtabliſh iuſtification by faith; which Chriſt obſeruing, directeth this ſpeech vnto them: <hi>Thinke not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I am come to diſſolue the law:</hi> as oppoſing this his ſpeech di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vnto their conceit, which they had of the aboliſhing of the law. Neither yet doth he here reſt: but in the ſecond place he ſheweth that he is ſo farre from the deſtroying of it, as that hee came to a quite contrarie end; namely to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill it. Now he which doth fulfill it doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it: for theſe are oppoſed by him as being contrarie the one to the other. For it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him both to deſtroy the law, and yet to fulfill it. Neither yet doth hee here content himſelfe to ſhew the end of his comming, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fulfill the law; but when he hath done, hee ſheweth in the third place the durablenes of this law, and that there is nothing ſo laſting as it; no not the heauens, though neuer ſo conſtant in their motion; nor the earth, though neuer ſo fixed a center: for they ſhall both paſſe away be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; the whole law doth he ſay ſhall paſſe? Nay
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:20637:16"/> rather than the leaſt iot or title of it ſhall eſcape or fall. And therefore whereas ſome ſay ſo much of the morall law ſhall ſtand, as Chriſt hath reeſtabliſhed in the new Teſtament, therein they graunt the very thing in queſtion: namely, that the Sabbath ſhall remaine: for Chriſt hath eſtabliſhed the whole law; yea and hath warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euery iot or title of it to be as durable as the heauens: and therefore vnleſſe wee can turne heauen and earth vpſide downe, let vs beware to take one iot or title from the law of God. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that wee may certainly know that neither this law, nor any part of it is diſſolued, hee ſheweth, that <hi>he that ſhall breake one of the leaſt commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> 
                     <note place="margin">As in Luke, thou childe ſhalt be called the Prophet of the higheſt, that is, ſhalt be.</note>

For (ſaith he) <hi>if your righteouſneſſe exceede not the righteouſneſſe of the Scribes and Phariſies, ye cannot enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen.</hi> Now as for thoſe that are of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that this place is to be vnderſtood of the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law which Chriſt did fulfill: though it be true that Chriſt did fulfill that alſo, yet that hee meaneth the ceremoniall law in this place, I cannot ſee how they will be able to prooue: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they will alſo hold, firſt, that the ceremonial law is not aboliſhed: ſecondly, that it ſhall laſt as long as the world laſteth: thirdly, that if a man breake the leaſt ceremonie thereof, and teach men ſo, that he ſhalbe the leaſt in the kingdom of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:20637:16"/> heauen: fourthly, that if hee obſerue and teach them, he ſhall be the greateſt in the kingdome of heauen: and fiftly that we are more bound vnto the obſeruation of them than were the Scribes and Phariſies, if wee will enter into heauen. All which things Chriſt verifieth here of that law of which hee maketh mention. All which if any dare be ſo ſhameleſſe as to affirme of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall law, yet they ſhall be vndone and proue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing thereby againſt vs, but all for vs: namely, that the Sabbath ſhall continue; it being as they ſay ceremoniall. But the truth is, it cannot be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of any other law than of the Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue or tenne Commaundements, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſhewed. And yet further to ſhew that Chriſts meaning was ſo, he preſently falleth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an expoſition of certaine precepts of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue, wherein the Phariſies had taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe.</p>
                  <p>But now will ſome man ſay, he doth not there expound the Sabbath; and therefore the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is not reeſtabliſhed. Anſw.

Beſides all this, I ſay, he may aboliſh by this reaſon the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements that are not there expounded. He muſt therfore know that there was another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that cauſed Chriſt not to ſpeake any thing of the Sabbath: for it was Chriſts intent and

(where he wils that his children which ſhould liue about 40. yeeres after his aſcention, ſhould pray that their flight might not be vpon the Sabbath) hee doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare that he held not this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in account of a ceremonie, but of a morall precept. For firſt, if it had been ceremoniall, they might haue fled without any care; for it had bin aboliſhed fourtie yeeres before. Secondly, hee ſhould haue done ill to haue vſed this as a ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crow, or as a bugge to fray children with, when there was no ſuch thing. Yea thirdly, if this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement had been ceremoniall, hee ſhould haue contradicted his owne doctrine, in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing that which himſelfe did take away by his death. And laſt of all, had he held it a ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, hee ſhould rather haue taught them not to haue ſtood vpon the keeping of it, being it had been a great ſinne for them to haue retained it, and made an account of it, it being aboliſhed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:20637:18"/> and done away before. Now as for thoſe that would qualifie Chriſts ſpeech, by ſaying that he ſpake not as he meant, but according vnto the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition of the Iewes, that held it vnlawfull (as they ſay) to flee vpon the Sabbath, and that ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his ſpeech was directed vnto them which held this error. Firſt, this their euaſion hath no ground. For how will they make it appeare that the Iewes held it vnlawfull vpon the Sabbath to flee for preſeruation of life, being they had no ground for it in the Scriptures? Secondly, their owne practiſe was to the contrary: for they fled out of Egypt vpon the Sabbath, Exod. 12. And as for that in the book of Macchabees, that ſome would not fight vpon the Sabbath, (beſides that it is no ſcripture) we ſee them in the ſame place condemned for it, and the caſe generally reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by their brethren to the contrarie, as they might well doe hauing ſuch preſidents in the Scriptures for their ſo doing; as 2. King. 11. and in the deſtructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iericho, Ioſh. 6. and elſwhere. Thirdly, if there had bin any infected with that error, he would rather haue willed them to haue prayed for the change of their mindes, than for the chaunge of their flight. Fourthly, be it that ſome held it vnlawfull to flee vpon the Sabbath; yet what was that vnto his Diſciples, who were not poſſeſſed with that error? for this was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken vnto his diſciples apart, as we ſee verſ. 3. And laſtly, if hee had ſpoken to ſuch as had held that error, he would rather haue continued his forme of ſpeech which he vſed in the former verſe; and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:20637:19"/> as there hee ſaith, Woe be vnto them which are with childe in theſe daies, manifeſtly ſpeaking of others: ſo he would rather haue continued that forme of ſpeech, and haue ſaid, Woe bee vnto them that in theſe daies ſhall hold it vnlawfull to flee vpon the Sabbath; for then had the ſpeech been plaine. But it is certaine that as the forme of Chriſts ſpeech was altered, ſo the words loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked quite another way: as namely vnto the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances and lets that might befall vnto them. And firſt to the bodily lets, if their flight ſhould fall in the winter, the ſhortnes of the day, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the fouleneſſe of the way, might bee comberſome: Therfore pray (ſaith he) that your flight be not in the winter. And with this it well fitted, that hauing ſet downe their bodily lets and grieuances, he ſhould in the ſecond place ſet downe the ſpirituall lets and grieuances, which might befall them if their flight ſhould bee vpon the Sabbath. For how could this but grieue them to ſee not onely abomination, or deſolation, in the Temple? but abomination of deſolation to be ſet vp in the high places, euen in place and ſteede of Gods worſhip, and that in the time of his worſhip alſo; how could this I ſay be any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than grieuous vnto them? and therfore ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding grieuous, becauſe then alſo vpon the ſight thereof they were to bee depriued both of Gods word and worſhip, and to bee driuen out into exile. Yet if troubles and afflictions muſt needs come, a man would deſire that they might not come at the worſt, or in the middeſt of his
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:20637:19"/> happineſſe. And if a man muſt needs die, yet he would deſire to end his prayers firſt, and firſt to be prepared thereto. In regard of which Chriſt willeth them to pray that their flight might not be vpon the Sabbath: that is, that though it were vneuitably decreed, that their flight ſhould bee; yet that the extremitie of it might be ſomething mitigated for the elects ſake. And this I hope that notwithſtanding theſe wrenches, it is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that Chriſts meaning was that the Sabbath ſhould continue.</p>

For what if the keeping of it bee not mentioned? doth it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow that it was not kept? Were all things that were done by the Fathers written by <hi>Moſes?</hi>

But to take away all wrangling; the truth is, the obſeruation of this day is alſo ſhewed by <hi>Moſes</hi> before the giuing of the law, aſwell as the inſtitution; and ſo ſhewed, as that he ſheweth it not once to be kept by God himſelfe in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Gen. 2. 2, but againe in the wilderneſſe; in that he ceaſed to raine downe Manna vpon the Sabbath, Exod. 16. 15.

And to this hee addeth the practiſe of man alſo: for Exod. 16. he ſheweth how the Iſraelites kept it in the wildernes, when as yet the ceremoniall law was not giuen; by which it is certaine that this law was perpetuall.</p>

Now to proue that we muſt keep euery day a Sabbath, they alleage that Heb. 4. 10. where it is ſaid, that <hi>he that is entred into this</hi>
                     <pb n="28" facs="tcp:20637:22"/> 
                     <hi>reſt hath ceaſed from his owne workes,</hi> as God did from his: and that therefore we muſt euery day keepe a reſt from ſinne. To which I anſwere: Were it ſo that all they that vrge this did it of a deſire and loue they haue to the Lords Sabbath, they were the leſſe to bee blamed: howbeit, it is certaine that they pleade this moſt that leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Sabbath when it comes; and they doe it not that they would haue other daies to be kept as the Sabbath; but becauſe they would haue the Sabbath; to be kept but as another day. But howſoeuer, yet I do not ſee how out of that place they may make this appeare. For firſt, I ſee not how Gods reſting from his workes, may be a figure of our reſting from our ſinfull workes, there being no proportion between them, which alwaies is betweene the ſigne and the thing ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified. Secondly, if this reſt were a ſigne or figure of our reſt from ſinne, it muſt be ſo vnto <hi>Adam</hi> alſo; for the law was giuen vnto him. Now how could that be a figure vnto him of his reſting from ſinne, when as yet hee had not ſinned? Thirdly, be it that there were ſuch a reſt, yet what doth the keeping of this reſt morally hinder the keeping of that from ſinne? nay rather is it not a principall meanes for the furtherance thereof? For doth not reſt from wordly affaires and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment in holie duties take away all occaſions of ſinne? Fourthly, were it granted that we muſt reſt euery day from ſinne; yet this their collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that therefore wee ſhould not reſt from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to keepe the Sabbath holy, followeth not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:20637:22"/> therupon; no more than becauſe a man is bound to receiue euery morſell of meate with giuing thankes, that therefore he ſhould ſay he were not bound to receiue the Lords Supper otherwiſe than as common bread; or rather not to receiue the Lords Supper at all, becauſe he euery day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth bread with giuing of thankes. Fiftly, that which in that place is made ſignificant, was the ſeuenth day from the creation: for the text ſaith, <hi>he ſpeaketh in a certaine place of the ſeuenth day,</hi> not <hi>of the Sabbath.</hi> Whereby it is plaine, that that which was ſignificant was the ſeuenth day from the creation, on which God is there ſaid to reſt; and it might be this was a ſigne that they ſhould in the like manner reſt vpon the ſeuenth day from their works as God did from his; to which end Gods example is brought as a reaſon to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs to reſt, becauſe God reſted: as alſo it might bee a ſigne of our eternall reſt in heauen. And that indeede the Apoſtle meaneth there, when hee ſaith verſ. 10. that <hi>hee which hath entred into his reſt,</hi> that is into heauen, <hi>hath ceaſed from his owne workes.</hi> What of ſinne? No, but of his calling: for this reſt <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould haue entred into though he had neuer ſinned. But (laſt of all) be it that in this place he meaneth this reſt from ſinne to bee ſhadowed out, yet that reſt is in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen: but in this life no man hath, or indeed can reſt from his ſinfull workes, as God did from his workes; which the Apoſtle affirmeth of thoſe that haue entred into his reſt. But this argument how wind-ſhaken it is, I hope euery man ſeeth. I
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:20637:23"/> will ſpend therefore no more time to pluck this thorne out of the drunkards hand. It reſteth that I ſhould here anſwere that which is vrged by ſome out of the Epiſtle vnto the Coloſſ. chap. 2. verſ. 16, 17. <hi>Let no man condemne you in reſpect of an holy day, or of the new Moone, or of the Sabbaths.</hi> But becauſe we ſhall haue a more fit oportunitie offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to ſpeake of it in the next chapter, I therefore thither remit the reader.</p>
                  <p>That which remaineth to be ſpoken of laſt of all, is the vſe of this, that being the Sabbath is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall, therefore men take heed how they ſuffer this truth to be wreſted away from them by the cunning ſleights of Sathan, or be drawne on by the alurements of euill men, to abuſe it to their owne pleaſures or profits, to runne, ride, or ſport themſelues vpon it, as if it were lawfull as vpon another day: or as if God had neuer ſaid the word, <hi>keepe it holy.</hi> And this much as touching the firſt point, namely that the Sabbath is perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.</p>

Which they might doe: firſt, becauſe the ſeuenth day kept amongſt the Iewes was ceremoniall, and did ſhadow out vnto vs our eternall reſt, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth Heb. 4. 4. 10. which was one cauſe that moued the Apoſtles to chaunge the day: As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo they might doe it, becauſe they found no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited day ſet downe in the commaundement. For as for that which followeth afterwards the ſeuenth is the Sabbath, it is no part of the morall
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:20637:24"/> precept, but onely an explication of it. For if that were a part of it, then this alſo muſt be a part, <hi>ſixe daies ſhalt thou labour;</hi> which to graunt were abſurd: becauſe then we ſhould make duties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt man and man to bee taught in the firſt table, which onely teacheth man this dutie to God: and the ſecond the dutie of man to man, as Chriſt ſheweth Matth. 22. 38. as alſo they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing two things ſo contrarie as reſt and labour, I cannot ſee but they muſt alſo be two commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements. Beſides all this in the reaſons, there be many things that concerned onely the Iewes, as in the fifth commaundement, <hi>Honour thy father and mother;</hi> the reaſon is, <hi>that thy daies may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giueth thee.</hi> Now it is certaine that this promiſe had only reference vnto the Iewes, whom the Lord brought out of the land of Egypt, and whom the Lord would bring into the land of Canaan. But vnto vs it is as the Apoſtle vrgeth it Epheſ. 6. 3, <hi>that thy daies may be long vpon earth.</hi> So in the firſt commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the bondage of Egypt:</hi> but wee may rather ſay, <hi>which brought vs out of the bondage of ſinne,</hi> or <hi>out of the bondage of Poperie.</hi> And Deut. 5. 15. he vſeth another reaſon to perſwade the Iewes, which doth not appertaine vnto vs; which was, that they ſhould keepe the Sabbath, <hi>becauſe they were ſeruants in Egypt.</hi> All which reaſons we ſee are vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in reſpect of them, as being the fitteſt to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade them, being taken from the preſent bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, which either they had, or were ſhortly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioy.
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:20637:24"/> And what letteth but that the like reſpect ſhuld be had in this commandement of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as in the former? You will happely ſay then, that there is ſomthing in the commandement that concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not vs, but the Iewes. Not ſo neither: for though there might bee ſome particular reaſons vſed that might more concerne them than vs, yet the commaundements might concerne vs both alike, they being the ſame with the law of nature written in our hearts, as alſo they being warranted vnto vs in the Goſpell to remaine. Though neither, yet if we ſhould graunt theſe words to bee part of the precept, doe they tye vs to keepe that ſeuenth day from the creation, but onely require of vs a ſeuenth to bee kept, which wee willingly embrace, as being the fitteſt time and the meeteſt for Gods ſeruice. And the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther becauſe the Apoſtles haue retained, and ſtill kept a ſeuenth day for Gods ſeruice; from whoſe example we may not varie.</p>

For if it bee perpetuall, how is it chaunged? if chaunged, how is it perpetuall? For anſwere whereunto, it is to be vnderſtoode that there is a two-fold conſideration or reſpect of the Sabbath; either as touching the ſubſtance of this commaundement, which is contained in theſe words, <hi>Remember thou keep holy the day of reſt,</hi> which is the ſame with the law of nature, and is ſo farre foorth warranted by Chriſt, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie heretofore prooued: or elſe, as it was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto the Iewes by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and had many ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and ſhadowes annexed vnto it, both 1. <hi>in the manner,</hi> 2. <hi>in the end, and</hi> 3. <hi>in the time.</hi> 1. <hi>In the manner,</hi> firſt they were to keepe it with offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring vp of ſacrifices vpon that day, as two lambes of a yeere old, two tenth deales of fine flower, &amp;c. Numb. 28. 9. Secondly, that they were more ſtrictly to keepe the reſt, ſo as they might not kindle a fire vpon that day, Exod. 35. 3. nor dreſſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:20637:25"/> their meate, Exod. 16. 23: which ſtrictnes of reſt was ceremoniall, and after the law was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, was added by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and therefore is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; the morall reſt required in the commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement notwithſtanding remaining, as being a thing ſo vnſeparably ioyned vnto holineſſe, as that wee cannot keepe the day holy without it. 2. <hi>In the end</hi> alſo there was ſomething ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall: for the Sabbath was made vnto them part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>memoratiue;</hi> as Deut. 5. 15. it was to bee kept <hi>in remembrance that they were ſeruants in Egypt:</hi> and partly it was <hi>repreſentatiue;</hi> for Exod. 31. 13. it was to be <hi>kept as a ſigne of their ſanctification.</hi> 3. And laſt of all, <hi>in the time,</hi> as I haue alreadie ſhewed, in that <hi>they kept the ſeuenth day from the creation.</hi> As al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in that <hi>they kept their Sabbath from euen to euen,</hi> Leuit. 23. 32. whereas the Church now keepeth the day firſt, and the night following. Whereof more hereafter.</p>
                  <p>Now all theſe additions concerned the Iewes onely, vnto whom they were giuen in charge to bee obſerued; yet no longer neither than vntill the comming of Chriſt, which was the bodie of all theſe ſhadowes. And therefore as touching al theſe complements of the Iewes: ſignifications of the reſt, ſacrifices of the day, obſeruation of the time from the creation; wee know them not hence-foorth, and therefore in reſpect of theſe let no man condemne vs. Yet let no man ſo much as imagine, that becauſe that which was ceremonial in it is done away, therefore the day, the reſt, the ſanctification of that day of reſt, or
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:20637:26"/> any ſubſtantiall thing in that law commaunded is done away. For as no man may ſay the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is aboliſhed, becauſe the ſigne is chaunged; no more may any man ſay the Sabbath is aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, becauſe the time is chaunged: for if euerie commandement that hath a ceremony annexed vnto it, ſhould therefore preſently be done away, or ſhould with the ceremonie become alſo cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall; it ſhould follow that moſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements ſhould be done away; for they had ceremonies annexed vnto them. As the ſixth Commandement had the ceremonie of things ſtrangled and of blood: for as they might not kill, ſo they might not ſtrangle or eate the blood. The fifth Commandement had the ceremonie of writing the law vpon their poſt, or of binding them vpon their hands: for as they were to teach the law, ſo by this ceremonie to teach. And all the ceremonies in Gods worſhip appertained vnto the ſecond, which commanding Gods out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip, muſt neceſſarily commaund theſe ceremonies by which he would be worſhipped: yea the whole law had the ceremonie of the parchment lace. Now, will you therefore ſay that all the law is ceremoniall and done away, becauſe theſe ceremonies are done away? If not, no more may you prooue that this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is done away, becauſe the ceremonie is done away. And therefore as this law was kept thouſands of yeres before theſe ceremonies were added: ſo I ſee no reaſon but that they may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thouſands of yeres after they be done away.</p>

Firſt, to put a difference betwixt the Iewiſh Sabbath <note place="margin">The reaſons of the change.</note> and the true Chriſtian Sabbath. Secondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as God the Father did ſanctifie the ſeuenth from the creation, by his reſting vpon it from the work of the creation; ſo did God the Sonne ſanctifie this ſeuenth from the redemption, by his riſing againe and reſting vpon it from the worke of the redemption. Thirdly, becauſe that this worke of the redemption being a greater work than that of the creation; and his reſt from affliction being a greater reſt than that from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; it better deſerued to beare the name and credit of the day, than that from the creation. Fourthly, becauſe Chriſt did vouchſafe alſo to honour this day aboue all the other daies of the weeke, by his ſeuerall appearings vpon it, as well as by his riſing againe vpon it. For vpon this day when hee roſe hee appeared foure times: firſt, to <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in the morning, Ioh. 20. 1. &amp; 14. Secondly, vnto the other women as they were going to relate vnto the Apoſtles his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Angels had told them of before at the ſepulchre, Matth. 28. 9. Thirdly, to the two Diſciples going to Emmaus; which alſo was the ſame day: for they ſaid it was the third day ſince theſe things were done, Luk. 24. 21. And laſtly,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:20637:28"/> the ſame day at night hee appeared vnto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, Ioh. 20. 19. but afterwards though <hi>Thomas</hi> his faith wanted confirmation in the matter of the reſurrection, yet hee did not againe manifeſt himſelf, vntill the returne of the ſame day: which <hi>Iohn</hi> noteth when he ſaith, hee appeared againe eight daies after vnto them, when <hi>Thomas</hi> was preſent. Fiftly, as Chriſt did vouchſafe to honor this day by his reſurrection, ſo alſo doth the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Ghoſt by his deſcention vpon it; for Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide or Pentecoſt did fall vpon that day, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is manifeſt. And laſt of all, vpon this day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the creation of the world; ſo that vpon this day wee haue to meditate both vpon our crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, redemption, and ſanctification. Now vpon all theſe reaſons the Apoſtles changed the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath into the firſt day of the weeke.</p>
                  <p>Now had they done it becauſe they might do it by their authoritie Apoſtolique, for they were lead into all truth by that ſpirit which could not erre: or had they onely done it becauſe it was meete to be done, that the people might be kept from Iudaizing, which in trueth inclined too much that way: or had they done it becauſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely the day was ceremoniall; who could haue iuſtly accepted againſt it? But now being they haue done it vpon ſuch reaſons as you haue heard, it were intollerable for any to call their doings againe into queſtion; eſpecially when as yet if we ſhould goe about to mend the choiſe, wee ſhould certainly marre with mending, and put out a better and fitter day, than wee ſhould
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:20637:29"/> put in the roome thereof. For if we ſhould place in the roome thereof a ſhorter time, men would crie out wee cannot diſpatch our buſineſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Sabbaths: if a longer, then Gods bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines ſhould be too much ſlacked; let vs therfore hold the meane which the Apoſtles haue kept, and in truth which euer hath been kept, namely one day of ſeuen holy.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>6</label> Yea, but will ſome man ſay, all this while wee ſee no Apoſtolicall inſtitution for this day. A ſtrange caſe when wee pleade the inſtitution of the Sabbath to prooue the perpetuitie of the Sabbath; then men call for the practiſe thereof: now we vrge the practiſe of the Apoſtles, for the chaunge of the day they call for the inſtitution.

If you haue, then what meane you yet to call for an inſtitution, whoſe practiſe alreadie you ſee, and whoſe example being not againſt the word, is a word? Although neither yet doe I doubt but that they being lead by the ſpirit into all truth, they had a warrant for their ſo doing; if not then from that ſpirit, yet from him who was
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:20637:29"/> Lord of the ſpirits, and of the Sabbath too: who had before his departing ſufficiently inſtructed them what to doe. Which I rather think, becauſe I ſee the practiſe of their aſſembling vpon that day before the holie Ghoſt was deſcended. Though in very deed I take this to be very great curiouſneſſe to inquire for their word, when we ſee their practiſe in aſſembling vpon this day; and if not the inſtitution, yet at leaſt an argument that there was ſuch an inſtitution amongſt them, in that it was called the Lords day.</p>

Therfore to make this appeare; firſt it is moſt certaine, that as in generall all the beaſts of the field are ſaid <hi>to be his,</hi> Pſalm. 50. ſo all the daies of the weeke may bee ſaid <hi>to be his.</hi> But more properly that day which is ſet apart to his ſeruice, is ſaid to be <hi>his.</hi> And in this ſenſe that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (wherein Chriſt departing did inſtitute the Sacrament) is called <hi>the Supper of the Lord,</hi> 1. Cor. 11. 20; the table, <hi>the Lords table;</hi> the cup, <hi>the cup of the Lord,</hi> 1.

So muſt it alſo neceſſarily here be taken that by <hi>the Lords day,</hi> the Apoſtle meant ſome one day that was famouſly knowne in the Church, to be conſecrated to his ſeruice, or elſe he would not ſo barely and nakedly haue paſſed it ouer; eſpecially if that were true that there had been ſo many Lords daies at that time kept as they would thruſt vpon vs; the Apoſtle had neede to haue made his ſpeech plaine vpon which of theſe hee
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:20637:31"/> was rauiſhed <hi>in the ſpirit.</hi> But it is moſt certaine that in the Scripture there is not any other day mentioned than this; and therefore it muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently bee vnderſtood of this. It being then kept (as I haue ſhewed) in the Apoſtles times, and the other daies then not obſerued, but brought in afterwards: And that it was ſo it will appeare yet more plainly, if we giue any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit vnto that which Maſter <hi>Beza</hi> noteth, which is that he found in a certain ancient Greeke cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie theſe words, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, that is, <hi>the Lords day</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the text, 1. Cor. 16. 2. which words being added, the text muſt runne thus, <hi>euery firſt day of the weeke which is the Lords day,</hi> &amp;c. And ſo it is plaine that by the firſt day of the weeke, muſt be meant <hi>the Lords day.</hi> As alſo is euident by that which Maſter <hi>Iunius</hi> obſerueth out of the Syriak tranſlation; which is, that whereas it is in the Greeke, <hi>when yee are come together in the Church;</hi> in the Syriak it is, <hi>when yee are come together on the Lords day;</hi> which maketh the truth of this fullie to appeare, that this firſt day of the weeke, vpon which we keepe our Sabbath, was <hi>the Lords day.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further to make it euident that this day <note place="margin">That the firſt day of the weeke is the Lords day, ſhewed alſo by the Fathers.</note> was <hi>the Lords day,</hi> the Fathers who came neereſt vnto the Apoſtles times, giue euident teſtimony.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:20637:31"/> Laſtly, deliuereth the time of all this their mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which was <hi>vpon the Sonday,</hi> as he calleth it: firſt, becauſe on it God began to create the world. Secondly, becauſe on it Chriſt roſe again from the dead; by which it euidently appeareth that this day was then kept. And <hi>Ignatius</hi> as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as he, ſheweth in his Epiſtle <hi>ad Magneſianos,</hi> not only that this day was choſen of the Church, but alſo why it was done: namely, that all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions might be cut off from the Chriſtians of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daizing.

Loe thus haue you a clowde of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, all teſtifying this day to bee <hi>the Lords day:</hi> but of the other daies which they call feaſts, no ſuch matter. Neither yet had theſe feaſts been ſo ancient, would any of them ſo iuſtly deſerued the name of the Lords day as this: becauſe in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he did ſo much ſhew himſelfe to be Lord, as in this his riſing againe from the dead: for <hi>therefore hee died and roſe againe, that hee might bee Lord of the quick and dead,</hi> Rom. 14. 9. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the Lord would haue the Iſraelites after their comming out of Egypt, there and then to begin the account of their moneths in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their great deliuerance from their bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, in which they were in vnder <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus 21. 2. ſo would hee haue vs, in remembrance
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:20637:32"/> of our great deliuerance from the thraldome of ſinne and ſpirituall bondage of the diuell, by Chriſts ſuffering and riſing againe, there and then to begin our account.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion then of this point is, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſeuenth from the creation was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the morall law, but was ceremoniall, and therefore meete to be changed, and being it might bee done without any preiudice to the commaundement. The Apoſtles did well to change the time of the Sabbath, which was kept euery ſeuenth from the creation, into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth from the redemption.</p>

And here firſt may theſe places of the Apoſtle, Galat. 4. 10. and Col. 2. 16, 17. incomber ſome, whoſe mindes are not ſo well eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth: in the firſt of which places the Apoſtle ſeemeth to condemne <hi>all ſet times;</hi> and in the ſecond, to cleere men from any iuſt imputation, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation for the <hi>not keeping of them,</hi> and by name <hi>of the Sabbaths;</hi> ſo that it may ſeeme we are ſet free from keeping any Sabbaths at all: for ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Let no man condemne you in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sabbath.</hi> For anſwere whereunto, as I will not greatly contend for the time of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, it being (as I haue alreadie ſhewed) done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the aboliſhing thereof may by this
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:20637:32"/> place iuſtly be warranted; for hee here ſpeaking againſt the obſeruation of times, eſpecially thoſe that were Iewiſh, it may as iuſtly be extended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the time of the Iewiſh Sabbath, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther feaſt amongſt them; eſpecially being that the time of the Sabbath is called <hi>the Sabbath,</hi> as in this commandement the ſeuenth is the Sabbath; that is the time of the Sabbath: and Leuit. 23. 3. <hi>The ſeuenth ſhall be the Sabbath of reſt,</hi> that is, the time of reſt, or the time of the Sabbath. As (I ſay) I will not contend with them for the day which the Iewes kept, it being aboliſhed: ſo by no meanes can I be drawne ſo much as once to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that therefore the Sabbath ſhould be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Iewiſh day aboliſhed, being that Chriſt hath warranted the whole law and euery iot or tittle of it to remaine.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but you will ſay the Sabbath it ſelfe is ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall; for Exod. 31. 13. it is made <hi>a ſigne of our ſanctification.</hi> A ſigne; what then? Is it therefore a ceremonie, and ſhadow? Is there no difference (thinke you) betweene <hi>a ſigne</hi> and <hi>a ſhadow?</hi> For my part I haue euer held, that <hi>ſhadowes ſignifie things to come,</hi> but <hi>ſignes things alreadie come aſwell as to come.</hi> Againe, ſhadowes and the bodie or ſubſtance of them can neuer bee together, but when the one is come the other is gone; and where the one beginneth, there the other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth: but the ſigne and the thing ſignified ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer agree better than when they goe together. Indeede I confeſſe the ſhadowes may in ſome ſenſe bee ſaid to bee ſignes: but that all ſignes
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:20637:33"/> ſhould bee ſhadowes, that will neuer bee made good by the dint of any argument, be it neuer ſo ſharpe. As for example, the <hi>ſignes</hi> in Egypt were tokens of Gods anger, yet they were not ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes: the Sacraments are ſignes confirming our faith, Rom. 4. 10. yet no ſhadowes: the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles that Chriſt wrought were ſignes ſhewing foorth his glorie, Ioh. 2. 11, yet no ſhadowes: the Rainbow was a ſigne, putting God in minde of his couenant that hee would not againe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time drowne the earth, Gen. 9. 13. and 15; and then may not the Sabbath alſo be a ſigne? that is, a document or inſtruction to teach vs our ſanctification; or a ſigne memoratiue to put vs in minde of our ſanctification, but that it muſt preſently therewith become a ſhadow? Why then become not all theſe ſignes ſhadowes aſwel as it? Indeede I confeſſe that the ſtrict keeping of the reſt by the Iewes, commanded Exo. 16. 23. was a ſhadow as alſo was the ſeuenth day: yet that the reſt commanded in the precept was ſo, or had any ceremonie annexed, that I denie. But be it ſo, that the reſt in the commandement had alſo a ſignification added vnto it; yet <hi>from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning it was not ſo,</hi> but came afterwards and was made ſo vnto the Iewes, (who were to be lead on vnto Chriſt by theſe things, as children by their A. b. c. and firſt elements as it were of religion) and may not this that is meerely accidentall and added vnto it fall away, but that it muſt deſtroy that alſo with it which is ſubſtantiall? If this ſhould be graunted, I ſee not but that the whole
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:20637:33"/> law muſt alſo be aboliſhed, becauſe there was no commandement but had ſome ceremonie or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (as I haue alreadie prooued) added vnto it. Yea and the Sacraments muſt alſo bee done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, becauſe the outward ſignes were ſhadowes; and ſo we ſhould be without either word or Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, with which this would ſuite well to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſh the time of them both, that there might not bee ſo much as any ſpeech of God or godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But how farre much better haue the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles done? who haue aboliſhed that which was ceremoniall and added vnto the morall law, retaining and keeping ſtill the ſubſtance and law it ſelfe: as alſo they doe in retaining and kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the ſame Sacraments which the Iewes had, 1. Cor. 10. 3, 4, though they chaunge the ſignes which they had. And what I pray you hath this commaundement deſerued why it ſhould not finde the like fauour with the reſt, to remaine, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the day bee changed; but that together with the day it muſt be quite caſhered from the reſt of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandements, as vnprofitable? This it is, the diuell knoweth that by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> keeping of this commandement, his kingdom is moſt of all ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and therefore hee laboureth aboue all to ſhake at leaſt, if not to ouerthrow this time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the worſhip of God.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>10</label> Yea, but in that place of the Galatians the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſeemeth altogether to diſallow ſet times, <note place="margin">That of the Galatians falſely vrged by ſome, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> in ſo much as he ſaith, <hi>he is afraid that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his labour vpon them in vaine, becauſe they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue daies and times.</hi> But of thoſe that vrge this, I
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:20637:34"/> would know whether they thinke that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle in this place condemneth all ſet times, or ſome onely: if they ſhall ſay all indifferently; then it ſhall not be lawfull for the Church at all to appoint any ſet times, no not for the deliuerie of the word and Sacraments: which whoſoeuer maintaineth is an abſolute Atheiſt, and ſeeketh no leſſe than the ruine of Chriſt and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and of all religion amongſt men. How be it, this I know thoſe that vrge this will not allow of it, to haue a day ſet for Gods worſhip, being a thing both tending to edification, and good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Now if they will ſay, that it condemneth but ſome ſet daies, then it either condemneth thoſe which the Church then kept, or thoſe which the Iewes kept; for there were not a third ſort of daies at that time. If they ſhall ſay thoſe which the Church then kept, I would know of them whether the Church might not then as lawfully appoint daies for Gods ſeruice as now, the Apoſtles being then of the Church, and lead by that ſpirit that could not erre. And ſecondly, whether they might not appoint the firſt day of the weeke as well as any other, all daies being (as they ſay) indifferently alike. Both which things if they will graunt, I ſee not how the Apoſtle might iuſtly blame them for vſing their chriſtian libertie, in making choiſe of ſome day for to keepe the Lords Sabbath vpon. Whom if hee might not iuſtly blame for vſing their libertie, much leſſe then might hee ſo ſharply rebuke them, as <hi>to ſtand in feare of them for the keeping of</hi>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:20637:34"/> 
                     <hi>ſuch a day,</hi> as if by it all his labours had been to none effect, or purpoſe. Yea, if the keeping of ſuch times had been ſo bad; he ſhould haue yet done much worſe, himſelfe to haue kept it with them, which yet hee doth Act. 20. 7. But this hee ſhould haue added aboue all, that hee ſhould ſpeake againſt times ſet, and yet ſhould himſelfe ſet times, as we ſee he did (in the Church of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth, yea and in this very Church of Galatia) appoint collections to be made euery firſt day of the weeke, as wee may ſee 1. Cor. 16. 1: all which things or any of them once to conceiue of ſo great an Apoſtle, were intollerable. It remaineth therefore neceſſarily, that they muſt bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of thoſe Iewiſh daies and times and yeres. And that they were ſuch, appeareth euidently Col. 2. 17, where he ſheweth that theſe daies were ſhadowes of things to come, which onely was proper to thoſe Iewiſh daies, and no other. And indeed the truth was thus, there were crept into theſe Churches certaine falſe Apoſtles, that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to ioyne <hi>Moſes</hi> with Chriſt, and to inthral their conſciences with the ceremoniall yoke, as though they were in conſcience bound yet to keep the ceremonial law: the retaining of which was no leſſe than in effect to denie Chriſt to bee come, who was the bodie of all thoſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall ſhadowes. Which he obſeruing, beginneth to be afraid of them, as he ſaith, leaſt they ſhould by this meanes haue made his preaching of Chriſt Ieſus to haue been of none effect vnto them. Now as for our parts we are ſo farre from
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:20637:35"/> Iudaizing, as that we retaine neither any conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their daies, nor yet the daies themſelues. And therefore we obſerue the Sabbath vpon the firſt day of the weeke, whereas they kept it vpon the ſeuenth (as hath been heretofore ſufficiently declared) that thereby we may be ſure to auoide all Iudaiſme.</p>
                  <p>Moreouer being the day is chaunged, it will <note place="margin">§. <hi>Sect.</hi> 11.</note> be demanded, and of ſome is, whether we ought not for the auoiding of Iudaiſme, to forbeare to call it the Sabbath day? Whereto for my part I anſwere, that although I know that all things ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall in the Sabbath bee aboliſhed, yet I could neuer learne that the name was any cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, and therefore I ſee not but that it may bee vſed with that indifferencie as wee vſe other names, it being fit and apt to expreſſe the nature of that which we would ſignifie by it. Secondly, being the reſt is perpetuall (as I haue prooued) why ſhould it not carrie with it the perpetuitie of the name of reſt? But why then were new names giuen vnto it? Not becauſe the old names were aboliſhed, or might not bee vſed, but they were inforced to vſe other names for diſtinctions ſake: for if they had not called the Sabbath by ſome other name, they could not haue been ſo wel vnderſtood whether they had ſpoken of the Iewes Sabbath that was to bee aboliſhed, or of ours; therefore to auoide this ambiguitie they call it by another name, that they might thereby be the better vnderſtood. But now being that the Iewes Sabbath day is quite aboliſhed, and that
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:20637:35"/> cuſtome hath made it familiar, and vſe carried it vnto our Sabbath: I ſee not but that we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently vſe the name of Sabbath, euen as any of the reſt of the names of the day: eſpecially then when wee doe deſire moſt to expreſſe the reſt of the day, as when wee would expreſſe the change of it, to call it the firſt day of the weeke; and when the reaſon of the change, to call it the Lords day: ſo when we would expreſſe the reſt, to call it the Sabbath day. And this much as touching the chaunge of the Sabbath vnto the firſt day of the weeke.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>12</label> But now vpon this which I haue ſhewed that the time of the Sabbath might be and was iuſtly changed by the Apoſtles, it will be demaunded, and of ſome is, though ouer buſily I confeſſe (for we ſhould be more readie to keepe, than to alter the conſtitutions of the Apoſtles; yet I ſay it will be demaunded) whether the Church may not chaunge the day of the Sabbath vnto any other day of the weeke? To which I anſwere, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Church hath power, Gods warrant going before, vpon ſome extraordinarie occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as plague, famine, ſword, or ſuch like, vpon any of the weeke daies to inſtitute a faſt, as in Ioel. 2. 15. <hi>Sanctifie a faſt:</hi> or a feaſt, as Heſt 9. <hi>The feaſt of Purim is inſtituted:</hi> or to turne a faſt into a feaſt, Zach. 8. 19. <hi>The faſt of the fourth moneth and the faſt of the fifth ſhall be vnto the houſe of Iudah ioy and gladneſſe.</hi> Yet to chaunge this day, they may not: for this were to become as the Princes of Iudah to change the land-markes, Hoſ. 5. 10, and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:20637:36"/> to plucke vp Gods ſtakes and bounds which hee hath ſet for his Sabbath: yea to take away his Sabbath, and to appoint a day of our owne in ſteed thereof, were yet to come neere vnto the fact of <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> who in ſteede of fire from heauen brought ſtraunge fire, Leuit. 10. 1. which ſinne God puniſhed with death; and may not we feare the like at his hands, if in ſteed of that day which he hath appointed, we ſhal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute vnto him a day of our owne? for which if hee puniſh vs not, yet hee may iuſtly returne it vpon vs with this reproofe; <hi>Who required this at your hands?</hi> Iſai. 1. 12. But be it graunted, were it ſo that the Church might alter this; yet they muſt bee lead thereto by ſome great reaſon that may ouerwaigh that, for which it was inſtituted to bee kept vpon this day: but greater reaſons cannot bee yeelded for any day than for this of which wee haue ſpoken before, which being conſidered, there cannot another day be placed in the roome thereof; neither yet if another day might be placed could a fitter day be placed, and therefore not another ſo well. And therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo that this day is ſet apart by the church, I ſay more (though yet that were ſufficient) by the Apoſtles to be kept holie; let vs be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to keepe it holie, as the Apoſtles haue left it: knowing that although we may ſometimes ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie that which is common; yet wee haue no power to make that commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is ſanctified. For that is a deſtruction or a ſnare vnto a man, to deuoure that which is ſanctified, Prou. 20. 25.</p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:20637:36"/>
                  <p> Now that which may ſeeme to make againſt <note place="margin">That place of the Romanes chap. 14. ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planed.</note> this which I haue written, is that of the Apoſtle, Rom. 14. 5, 6; where hee ſeemeth to make all daies alike, either to bee obſerued or not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. True it is that hee ſaith ſome men count them ſo, but yet the Apoſtle maketh no ſuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: for the queſtion moued there, being, not betwixt the Iew and the Gentile, as ſome would haue it, but betwixt the ſtronger and the weaker, as appeareth chap. 15. 1. about eating of hearbes and keeping of daies, which aroſe as may ſeeme vpon this occaſion, that foraſmuch as the reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our former eſtate was now wrought by Chriſt: therefore wee, as in the beginning our fathers did, ſhould eate hearbes, and no fleſh. Now as in theſe controuerſies he ſetteth downe their tenents on both ſides, both what the ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger held, and what the weaker; ſo he ſheweth ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them their duties towards other. Now the tenents were thus; <hi>The ſtronger beleeued that they might eate all things, the weaker he eateth herbes.</hi> He doth not ſay <hi>beleeueth,</hi> as to the former, but <hi>eateth,</hi> thereby diſtinguiſhing it from the other. So againe verſ. 5. <hi>This man eſteemeth one day aboue another,</hi> that is the ſtronger, which appeareth in that there was a day both commaunded, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and approoued in the Church, as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie ſhewed: and therefore that muſt bee the ſtronger, then the weaker muſt needes be <hi>to hold euery day alike.</hi> So then if men count all daies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, it is an argument of their weakneſſe: yet we that are perſwaded that one day is aboue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:20637:37"/> as the Lords day aboue all the reſt, ought not to deſpiſe the weaker, but to beare with their infirmitie, ſo long as it may be for their good to edification, chap. 15. 2. And this is our minde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe that through ignorance or weaknes account of the Lords day but as of another day. So long as it may bee for their good to edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee will beare with their infirmitie: which yet if they ſhal hold obſtinately and defend with an high hand, we are to <hi>rebuke them ſharply, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may feare.</hi> Now if any man to auoide the point of this argument ſhall ſay, that the Iewes are they which are meant by the weake, becauſe <hi>they did eate herbes and obſerue daies.</hi> Firſt, I would haue them to ſhew me, where it may appeare, that they were reſtrained of eating fleſh. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if they were thoſe whom the Apoſtle meant that kept and obſerued daies: I would know of them alſo whether they thinke they kept them to the Lord, which the Apoſtle affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth; which if they ſay, I ſee not how the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle might be afraide of them ſo farre, that hee might thinke he had laboured amongſt them in vaine, in that they kept a day holy vnto the Lord. And this much touching this queſtion, whether the day of reſt may be chaunged againe, or not.</p>

And to that end he beareth thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands in hand, that they are not bound to reſt the whole day and keepe the whole day holie; but onely the time of the publike exerciſes. But for this they are to know, that God requireth in the commandement that we reſt the whole day, and that we keepe the whole day holy: for if he had meant but a part of the day, he could haue ſaid ſo much; but in that he requireth a day in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement he putteth it out of queſtion. If thou thy ſelfe ſhouldeſt hire a man to worke with thee a day, wouldeſt thou not looke that hee ſhould worke with thee a whole day? Or a ſeruant to dwell a yeere with thee, wouldeſt thou not looke that hee ſhould dwell a whole yeere with thee? How is it then that thou vnderſtandeſt God to halfes, when his word is as plaine as thine? Doeſt thou not think that <hi>Ananias</hi> was iuſtly puniſhed, becauſe he brought but a part, when hee ſhould haue brought the whole? And ſhall not God as iuſtly puniſh thee, if thou keepeſt but a part,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:20637:38"/> when thou ſhouldeſt keepe the whole? Indeede this word <hi>whole</hi> is not expreſſed, but yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and neceſſarily vnderſtood, in that hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a day. And that his meaning is ſo, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth euidently alſo by the reaſons hee bringeth afterwards, to perſwade thee thereunto. For firſt thou knoweſt the whole weeke conſiſteth of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen daies. Of theſe he giues thee ſixe, and keepes one for himſelfe; now ſuch daies as he giues thee to doe thy buſineſſe in, ſuch and ſo long a day he reſerues for himſelfe; but euery one of thy daies hath foure and twentie houres: and therefore he muſt haue ſo many to his day, or els thou haſt more than ſixe daies giuen thee; or if not giuen, then thou takeſt it as <hi>Hophnie</hi> did the fleſh: and then thou robbeſt God of part of his day, and ſo thou committeſt theft; which, were the caſe thine owne, thou wouldeſt not endure. For if thou hauing ſeuen pounds in thy purſe, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt giue ſixe of them to ſome debauſhed ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier; if hee ſhould waſtfully ſpend that thou ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſt him on harlots, and then afterwards ſhould come and take from thee all the remainder ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing two or three ſhillings; wouldeſt thou not thinke that he did incroch two much vpon thee? wouldeſt thou not ſay he hath robbed me? And bee not theſe as great theeues that rob God, as thoſe that rob men? Doubtleſſe they be greater; and therefore take no part of this day from God to ſpend vpon thy luſts; for it is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; and take heede how thou wrong him, and curtoll his day, as <hi>Hanun</hi> did
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:20637:38"/> 
                     <hi>Dauids</hi> ſeruants garments, 2. Sam. 10. 4: for hee will not take this wrong at thine hands. Againe, in the third reaſon where God propoſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe vnto thee for an example to follow; looke how long a time God reſted, ſo long a time muſt thou reſt. But hee reſted the ſeuenth day wholy, for he made nothing the ſeuenth day, but finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all in ſixe daies: and therefore muſt thou reſt a whole day as hee did. Laſtly, in the laſt reaſon, looke what time God bleſſed and ſanctified to be kept holie, that time ought in right to be kept holie, (for this is the nature and propertie of things ſanctified, they being ſet apart from the common vſe, may not otherwiſe be imployed than vnto his honour, as appeareth Leuit. 27. 28. Yea <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> as very a beaſt as he was, yet would not put the veſſels of the houſe of God to a common vſe; but put them in the houſe of his God, Dan. 1. 2.) but now (I ſay) God bleſſed and ſanctified the whole day which he reſted on, and therefore the whole day muſt be kept holie. And in very truth is not a whole day needfull for the performance of a whole ſeruice and worſhip of God? to heare the word, and miniſter the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, pray, reade, meditate, conferre, inſtruct? And why then doe men thinke that they haue ſufficiently kept the Sabbath if they heare diuine ſeruice, as they call it, in the forenoone, and in the afternoone? thinking that they may doe all the reſt of the day what they liſt; as though God forſooth would take that at mans hands, which a man will not at his ſeruants; to worke an houre
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:20637:39"/> or two, and to play all the reſt of the day. But the Apoſtle, you will ſay, willeth that we ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demne no man in part of an holie day, Col. 2. 16. True; neither in reſpect of an whole holie day, ſuch as hee there meaneth; that is, a Iewiſh holie day; which, as I haue ſhewed before, you are not bound vnto. But this <hi>is the Lords day,</hi> and it is <hi>the Lords Sabbath</hi> which you muſt keepe holie, and wholie holie vnto him; as you haue ſeene alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die prooued: for 1. the day, 2. preparation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, 3. reſt, and 4. holineſſe; theſe foure things being in the commandement expreſſed, we muſt obſerue for euer, as being morall and not cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall.</p>

Though neither yet doe I ſpeake it to this end, that wee ſhould keepe it in the ſame manner as <hi>Paul</hi> did, I know it well it was extraordinarie, but yet neuertheleſſe in the nature of a night we are more holily to repoſe our ſelues that night, than at other times.

True it is that the Iewes kept their Sabbath the night before the day; for Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. 23. 32. <hi>from euen to euen ſhall you celebrate your Sabbath;</hi> but wee begin our Sabbath at the daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the day, for theſe reaſons: firſt, becauſe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Chriſt roſe in the dawning it was neceſſarie (our Sabbath being to be kept in remembrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) that our day ſhould then begin. Secondly, to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> put a difference betwixt the Iewiſh Sabbath, and the true Chriſtian Sabbath, it was needfull that ours ſhould begin at morning, when by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt the world began to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed: whereas the other began at night, when the world in the creation was finiſhed. Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> that the night following is accounted a part of the day precedent, we ſee Act. 20. verſ. 7. where it is ſaid that <hi>Paul</hi> preached at Troas vntill mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, being the next morning to depart, hauing ſtaied there, as the text ſheweth, verſ. 6. ſeuen
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:20637:40"/> daies: but if the laſt night had not been a part of the ſeuenth day, then he had ſtaied at leaſt a night longer than ſeuen daies, and ſo more than ſeuen daies, for hee ſhould haue ſtaied part of another day. But that this night was a part of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath which they then kept, doth yet further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, in that the Apoſtle keepeth this night in the manner of a Sabbath, with performing the exerciſe of holineſſe therein; as alſo in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to depart, hee would not depart till the reſt were ended. Which I obſerue in that it is ſaid, ver. 11, that <hi>he communed with them till the dawning of the day, and ſo departed;</hi> both which circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces concurre well with this, to prooue that hee held the night following to be a part of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. Now if any man will ſay, that by this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we may iuſtifie the deliuerie of the word and Sacrament in the night; I graunt it, the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this was, a time of perſecution: otherwiſe not. But this, to keepe the night of the Sabbath in the nature of the night, I take to be no extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie, but an ordinarie thing, ſuch as is now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo required of vs; and I preſſe it no further than to ſhew the practiſe of the Church, from which wee ought not raſhly or vnaduiſedly to diſſent. And this hath been obſerued euer ſithence the Apoſtles times to be iuſt, who keep the day firſt, and call the night following by the name of the day precedent. And ſo much for the day of reſt.</p>

All which things being diſcuſſed, it remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that we proceede vnto the handling of the duties of the day. And firſt I will ſpeake of the preparation vnto the Sabbath, which we are put in minde of when he wils vs <hi>to remember this day:</hi> which words import ſo much as if hee ſhould haue ſaid, Thou art by nature forgetfull, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in the performance of any holie dutie; and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:20637:41"/> therefore thou haddeſt neede to thinke vpon this day before hand, and to remember it, that thou <note place="margin">Why the word <hi>remember</hi> is placed before the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</note> maiſt bee prepared to keepe it holie. And me thinkes God deales in this like a Maſter, that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing many things in charge vnto his ſeruants, yet one thing in ſpeciall; aboue all (ſaith he) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this. So dealeth God in this caſe, Thou ſhalt haue none other Gods, Thou ſhalt not make any grauen image, Thou ſhalt not take my name in vaine; theſe commaundements thou ſhalt obſerue; but eſpecially remember this to ſanctifie my Sabbath. And although this word <hi>remember</hi> bee placed but in the beginning, yet it hath a reference vnto euery word in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement: for he requireth not onely that we ſhould remember the day when it is comming, but alſo we muſt remember to reſt vpon it when it is come. Neither is it ſufficient that we reſt on that day, but we muſt remember to ſanctifie that reſt; and that thou muſt remember to do thy ſelf, and not that alone, but that thy children and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants alſo doe it. Indeed, were it not that wee were more negligent in this than in any other dutie, God would not haue vſed this ſpeciall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: but ſeeing in good things wee are like the Diſciples that ſlept, though thrice admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, when the Phariſies could wake well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough without any admonition at all; God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore willeth vs to remember the Sabbath, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by as it were ſtirring vs vp to the performance of our duties. And as God willeth vs to remember in regard of our forgetfulneſſe in good matters;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:20637:41"/> ſo doth he will vs much more to remember in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the eaſineſſe that is in our nature, to bee drawne away to that which is euill, from Gods ſeruice.

How ſay you to thoſe lets which kept thoſe that were bidden vnto the wedding, that they could not come? as merchandiſe, a farme, fiue yoke of oxen, a wife, and ſuch like? Are not theſe things many times lets vnto vs that we cannot keepe the Sabbath? Now for the preuenting of all theſe, God willeth vs to remember that it is his Sabbath; thereby ſhewing vs that the very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:20637:42"/> of the Sabbath muſt weigh downe all our worldly lets. O but faith the maſter (when hee ſhould goe to Church) I muſt needes goe talke with my ſeruants, and tell them what they ſhall doe the next weeke. Yea but thou muſt <hi>remember to goe to Church;</hi> for God will talke with thee, and tell thee what thou ſhalt doe the next weeke. I but (ſaith the ſeruant) my maſter commaunded me, and I muſt go do my maſters buſineſſe. Yea but God ſaith, thou muſt goe doe his buſineſſe, hee commaunds both thee and thy maſter too: and therefore remember the Sabbath, ſaith hee. Yea but, will ſome man ſay, I muſt needs go doe a thing I forgot to doe the laſt weeke. The more ſhame for thee; for doth not God will thee to remember it? Yea but I had forgotten it, and therefore now I muſt goe doe it. Indeed as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> through negligence thou going from home, and leauing thy cloake behind, if it ſhould chance to raine, and thou wanting thy cloake, ſhouldeſt therefore meeting thy neighbour take away his; were it therefore lawfull becauſe thou haddeſt forgotten thine? So, wilt thou becauſe through thy negligence, thou forgetteſt thy bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, when thou ſhouldeſt haue done it; wilt thou (I ſay) therefore take Gods time, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy it about thy buſineſſe? Well, I diſpute not whether it be lawfull to doe it; but this I am ſure it is ſinfull for thee to forget to doe it before: for thou ſhouldeſt haue remembred it; and indeede this doth nothing but argue thy vnto wardnes vnto good things: for thou vſeſt not ſo to pleade
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:20637:42"/> in the weeke daies, when thou ſhouldeſt goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thy worldly buſineſſe. Sir, I haue forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten this day to pray with my familie, to inſtruct them, to reade ſome part of the Scripture, &amp;c. Thou neuer remembreſt this in the weeke; or if thou doeſt, thou preſently diſpenſeſt with thy ſelfe for the omiſſion of it: but on the Sabbath thou eaſily remembreſt any of thy worldly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and thou wilt not omit to do them, though holineſſe it ſelfe attend thee in the meane ſeaſon. Which eaſily ſheweth what it is that runneth in our minds, namely our worldly affaires, for theſe we remember at euery turne: and not onely ſo, but we forecaſt all inconueniences before hand. As for example, is a man going to a market or faire? before he goes, he ſits down firſt and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts what things he lackes, where and of whom he may buy them at the beſt hand; yea he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members all his wants, and rather than hee will forget any of them when he comes thither, hee will ſet them downe in writing tables; or binde a threed about his finger, to put him in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; or elſe commaund ſome of his ſeruants to remember him when he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth thither, that he may be ſure to diſpatch all his arrands. But in Gods ſeruice no ſuch care, it is the eaſieſt thing in the world to forget that, wee are ſo ſlacke, ſo cold, ſo frozen, that wee forget any thing.

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:20637:53"/> and is it not meete to gather it vp? Yet I ſay for all this, thou muſt let it alone; for <hi>in ſeede time and in harueſt thou muſt reſt,</hi> Exod. 34. 21.

And the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that followed Chriſt out of Galilie, would not imbaulme the bodie of Chriſt vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, though it might haue been thought a work of great conſequence; but how great ſoeuer in the eyes of men, yet they would not doe it; and leaſt they ſhould bee blamed as being ouer cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſtrict in not doing of it, the holy Ghoſt defends them, and ſhewes they did well in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing; for they reſted (ſaith the text) according vnto the commandement, Luk. 22. 56.</p>
                  <p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>15</label> But now vpon this which I haue written, it will happely be deemed that I hold it vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull vpon the Sabbath to doe any kinde of
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:20637:54"/> worke at all. Which, that I may not be miſtaken, I will now ſet downe what kinde of works vpon <note place="margin">What workes may be done vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> the Sabbath be lawfull to be done, and in what caſes. For this wee muſt know, that there is no commandement ſo generall but it hath ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; eſpecially thoſe which are affirmatiue, for they are alwaies more milde, and binde not alwaies and at all times; of which ſort in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calogue there bee two, the fourth, and the fifth, both which haue exceptions; as in the fifth, <hi>Thou ſhalt honour thy father and mother,</hi> this is generally true: yet it may ſo fall out in ſome caſes that thou maiſt be exempt from thy dutie, if the honoring of them may diſhonour God: and therefore thy honour is limited in the Lord, Ephe. 6. 1. So here thou ſhalt doe no manner of ſeruile worke: yet (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>which of you is it that hauing an oxe, or an aſſe, fallen into the ditch on the Sabbath, doth not preſently help him out?</hi> Matth. 12. 11. Where Chriſt doth not, as ſome fooliſhly furmiſe, aboliſh the Sabbath as a ceremonie; but ſheweth that hee did no more in healing vpon the Sabbath, than they themſelues did in plucking the oxe or aſſe out of the ditch: thereby indeede making a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe ball of their argument, and retorting it vpon themſelues which they banded at him. But had Chriſt held the Sabbath to haue been aboliſhed, when they charged him with the breach there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he might eaſily haue anſwered, it is aboliſhed: but hee ſheweth quite contrarie that hee did no more breake the Sabbath in healing, than they did in plucking the oxe out of the pit: ſo that he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:20637:54"/> doth not here aboliſh the Sabbath, but rather e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh it by ſhewing the right obſeruation ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And to ſpeake the truth, Chriſt neither did, nor could aboliſh the ceremonial law, but by his death. Therefore hee is ſaid, Coloſſ. 2. 14. <hi>in his croſſe to take away the hand-writting which ſtood in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and to naile it vnto the ſame his croſſe:</hi> but in his life hee was obedient vnto it euen in all things: which I thinke no man will be ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent as to denie. This therefore being plaine, let vs returne vnto the exceptions which this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement admitteth: for notwithſtanding that the Lord commaundeth that ordinarilie a man may doe no ſeruile work vpon the Sabbath; yet this commandement admitteth three excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, if God extraordinarily commaund vs to <note place="margin">1. We may worke if God command vs.</note> worke vpon the Sabbath, we may worke: for <hi>he is Lord of the Sabbath,</hi> and therefore may giue a diſpenſation when he liſt. And therfore the man did well, Ioh. 5. 11. that at Chriſts commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>tooke vp his bed and did walke.</hi> So alſo did the <hi>Iewes</hi> that <hi>compaſſed Iericho on the Sabbath:</hi> for they were commaunded to compaſſe it ſeuen daies, whereof then the Sabbath muſt needes be one, Ioſh. 6. 14, 15. This is the firſt exception.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond is, that if the worke be neceſſarily <note place="margin">2. If the worke be neceſſarily required for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of Gods ſeruice.</note> required to the performance of the ſeruice of God, ſeruile or not, it muſt be done. <hi>As Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion on the eighth day,</hi> if it fell vpon the Sabbath it was to be done, Ioh. 7. 22. And <hi>the Priests on the Sabbath killed the ſacrifice, and were blameleſſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:20637:55"/> Matth. 12. 5. And in this reſpect the Miniſter on the Sabbath is allowed to go to preach, as Chriſt did vpon the Sabbath, Matth. 12. and the people are to goe to heare. An example whereof wee haue in the Shunamite, that went ordinarily vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sabbath and new Moone to the Prophet: For when ſhe demaunded leaue of her husband to goe to the Prophet, <hi>Why wilt thou goe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſeeing it is neither Sabbath nor new Moone:</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby that vpon thoſe times ſhe went to heare him. And in this regard was the Sabbath daies iourney allowed, Act. 1. 12. And therefore whoſoeuer ſhall breake the reſt of the Sabbath in this reſpect is blameleſſe. For, <hi>the Sabbath was made for man,</hi> that hee might keepe it holie vnto the Lord. Now, if it may ſo fall that the reſt it ſelfe ſhould any way bee a let to the keeping of it holie, then the reſt it ſelfe is to be broken: and they that ſo doe are blameleſſe. For the end of the law in this reſpect is to be regarded, and not the letter. For the Sabbath was made for man, that is, for the good of man; and not man for the Sabbath, that is for the reſt. And this is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of that place, Mark. 2. 27. <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, if it be a worke of neceſſitie; that is, <note place="margin">3. If it be of neceſſitie we may worke vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> a worke which the time preſent doth neceſſarily require to be done, and cannot be deferred vnto another day, without loſſe or hindrance; that ſame worke, whether it bee for preſeruation of life, health, or goods, muſt be done vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. All which I will ſhew. And firſt, for preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:20637:55"/> of life it is lawfull to breake the reſt of the Sabbath: for <hi>Elias continued his flight from Iezabel many Sabbaths together,</hi> 1. King. 19. 8. And this was the fault of the Iewes; but afterwards corrected by <hi>Iudas Macchab.</hi> that they would not fight on the Sabbath, for the preſeruation of their liues: for the Sabbath was not made for the hurt, but for the good of man.</p>
                  <p>And as it is lawful to break the Sabbath for the <note place="margin">Labour lawfull for preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of health vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> preſeruation of life, ſo is it for the preſeruation of health. Therefore the Phyſition may goe to viſit the ſicke. Chriſt himſelfe did ſo, Ioh. 5. 3. <hi>He went vnto the poole of Betheſda, where lay a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panie of ſicke folkes.</hi> And it is not onely lawfull to viſit, but alſo to cure; for he <hi>cured the blind man vpon the Sabbath,</hi> Ioh. 9. 14. The ſame is alſo war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted vnto the Chirurgion by Chriſts example to dreſſe the wounds, and temper the ſalues, Ioh. 9. 6. <hi>He ſpat on the ground, and made clay of the ſpittle, and annointed his eyes.</hi> And as theſe things may be done for the recouerie of health: ſo alſo may a man doe that which is conuenient, for the preſeruation and continuance of his health: for God would not allow that a man ſhould liue, but alſo that he might liue cheerfully: &amp; therfore <hi>the oxe was to be lead to the water,</hi> Luk. 13. 15. though he might haue liued one day without water. Now if this may be allowed for the good of the beaſt; then how much more for the good of man? In this caſe therefore it is lawfull vpon the Sabbath for a man to doe workes of comelineſſe, as to cloathe himſelfe. Secondly, to do things for our
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:20637:56"/> preſent vſe, as to dreſſe his meate, which is alſo warranted by the Diſciples pulling and rubbing of the eares of corne. Wherein alſo reſpect may be had of his place and degree, as <hi>Nehemiah had daily an oxe and ſixe ſheepe, beſides birds prouided for him,</hi> Nehem. 5. 18. Now if euery day, then on the Sabbath: yet here we muſt take heede that wee make not the Sabbath a day of feaſting, as in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places in the countrey they doe, keeping their feaſts not like <hi>Iobs</hi> children euery one his day, but euery one his Sabbath day. A good rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the ordring of this, will be vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath not to exceede our ordinarie. Thirdly, this alſo giueth libertie for the dreſſing of our cattell, milking of our kine, and ſuch like; without which things life it ſelfe is not ſo comfortable vnto them. Laſt of all, as all theſe things may be done for preſeruation of health; ſo alſo may we labour vpon the Sabbath for the preſeruation of <note place="margin">Labour vpon the Sabbath for preſerua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of goods, lawfull.</note> our goods, being in danger of loſing them. <hi>Which of you is it</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that hauing an oxe or an aſſe fallen into the ditch, doth not pull him out?</hi> All which things as they may bee done vpon the Sabbath, ſo if neceſſitie be, they muſt preſently bee done; and the exerciſes of the Sabbath neglected for the doing of them; for <hi>Chriſt will haue the oxe pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led preſently out of the pit,</hi> Luk. 14. 5. And in regard of this it is that he requireth <hi>mercie and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> not but that hee will haue both: but if the caſe ſo ſtand that hee cannot haue both at once, but muſt content himſelfe with one, hee had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther haue <hi>mercie than ſacrifice.</hi> And therefore <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="95" facs="tcp:20637:56"/> when <hi>Eutiches</hi> was fallen downe dead, left prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to recouer him to life: and the Iſraelites, though they were commaunded not to touch a carrion, yet they muſt take vp <hi>Ioſephs</hi> bones, Exo. 13. 19. And Mat. 5. though he commands thee to offer ſacrifice, yet <hi>if thy brother haue ought againſt thee,</hi> thou muſt <hi>firſt goe and be reconciled, and then come.</hi> So that in all theſe reſpects, howſoeuer the law commaunds a preciſe reſt; yet as we ſay, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsitie hath no law;</hi> ſo truly may wee ſay, <hi>it hath no Sabbath daies.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>16</label> But yet in doing theſe workes of neceſſitie, three things muſt diligently bee taken heed of. <note place="margin">Cautions to be obſerued in doing the workes of neceſsitie.</note> Firſt, that we ſend not for excuſes, and make mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of neceſſitie, when before hand wee might haue preuented the neceſſitie. As for example, if a man owe a ſumme of money vpon a band, and neglect the taking of order for the paiment of it, vntill the day be ſo neere that he muſt needs tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile on the Sabbath to diſcharge his band. Alſo when a man is ſerued with proceſſe to appeare on ſuch a day at Weſtminſter, hee hauing time enough deferreth it ſo long, that he muſt needes trauaile vpon the Sabbath to come there by his day, and by this meanes bringeth a neceſſitie vpon himſelfe, which God neuer laid vpon him; all which neceſſities, if men did well conſider before hand, might be eaſily auoided. Well, but when a man hath negligently runne into this ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie, whether may hee then trauaile vpon the Sabbath? I ſay, if it bee of neceſſitie to be done, thou maiſt doe it: but thou muſt withal remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:20637:57"/> to crie to God for mercie for forgetting his Sabbath, which thou ſhouldeſt haue remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred. The ſecond thing that muſt be taken heed of is, that no recompence be taken for the labour which thou doeſt vpon this day: for by that meanes thou makeſt it a ſeruile worke. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it will be a meanes to leade thee on to this ſin of Sabbath-breaking: for rewards do blinde the eyes. And thirdly, be well aſſured that God will neuer bleſſe that hire, but it ſhall be vnto thee like the Manna that the Iſraelites gathered more than needed, that rotted and ſtunke, Exod. 16. The laſt caution is, that when we are thus forced by neceſſitie to breake the Sabbath, that then we haue an eſpeciall care ſometime of the weeke to repay that time, which we tooke on the Sabbath, by imploying ſo much of the weeke vnto holie exerciſes; ſo that although God hath not the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe time preſcribed which he requireth, yet hee may haue at leaſt the equitie thereof; ſo much time.</p>
                  <p>Now there be, I know, that vnto theſe workes <note place="margin">All workes of mercie may not be done vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> which God hath in his word diſpenſed with to be done vpon the Sabbath, doe adde moreouer all works of mercie, which I take may no further be done vpon the Sabbath, than they come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one of the foreſaid limitations, that is, that they be either in ſpeciall commanded, as 1. Cor. 16. 1. As firſt, collections for the poore; of which kinde alſo are viſiting of the poore, and ſicke, and ſuch like: or ſuch as godlineſſe requireth, as a man may trauaile to bring others vnto the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:20637:57"/> of religion, or neceſſitie inforceth vs vnto; of which before. But if neither of theſe leade vs thereunto, though they be workes of mercie, yet they muſt be deferred. As for example, a poore man hath an aker of corne to bee cut, who is not able to pay for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cutting of it, neither yet to cut it himſelf. Now to help ſuch a man, there is no man but wil ſay it is a deed of charity to cut his corne; yet if his neighbours ſhould, ſome ſixe or ſeuen of them, euery one take his ſithe, and cut downe his corne vpon the Sabbath, they ſhould breake the Sabbath, and ſhould cleane contradict Gods commandement, that forbiddeth them to doe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeruile worke vpon the Sabbath; for this cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to our neighbour muſt not take away our dutie to God, nor hinder it, vnleſſe as before.</p>
                  <p>The concluſion then of this point is this: That no kinde of ordinarie or ſeruile worke may bee done vpon the Sabbath; neither in the houſe, nor in the citie, nor in the fields; nor vpon the ſeas, be they neuer ſo ſmall, or neuer ſo meete, or neuer ſo glorious in ſhew, except either God commaund it extraordinarily; or that the worke tend directly to Gods worſhip: or be of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie either for the preſeruation of life, or health, or goods; in which reſpects God hath giuen vs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance vpon the Sabbath to worke, and not otherwiſe.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Vt now doth God meane that theſe workes of our ordinarie vocation <note place="margin">Paſtimes vpon the Sabbath vnlawfull.</note> are only forbidden, and no others? Surely no: for as I will neuer think that when <hi>Dauid</hi> prayed, <hi>Lord turne away mine eyes that I behold not vanitie,</hi> Pſal. 119. 37; he meant that his eares ſhould ſtand open to heare vanitie: no more will I thinke that when God did forbid works of our ordinarie vocation; that he meant to allow works of pleaſure, ſuch as are our works of recreations, and paſtimes, as we call them. Which will the better appeare, if wee conſider the reaſon why theſe workes of our or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie vocation are forbidden vs vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath: which is, not that they are vnlawfull in themſelues, but becauſe they deſtroy <hi>the reſt,</hi> and take vp the mind that it cannot be imployed in Gods buſineſſe; now theſe doing the ſame things, are by the ſame reaſons forbidden. Wee muſt vnderſtand therefore that this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is of the ſame nature with the reſt, and as in them by one ſinne forbidden, are vnderſtood all of the ſame kinde: (as by murther is forbidden all crueltie, whether inward, or outward: and by
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:20637:58"/> adulterie all wantonnes, and vncleannes: as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending againſt chaſtitie, Matth. 5.) ſo by theſe ſeruile workes named, as breaking the reſt of the Sabbath, are forbidden al workes that breake the reſt of the Sabbath: onely thoſe excepted which God hath diſpenſed with, of which before. And therefore all ſuch workes as are done for recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as bowling, ſhooting, hunting, hawking, wreſtling, playing at cat, and ſuch like; howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer in the weeke they may be allowed, yet are vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this day vtterly vnlawfull and forbidden. Yea and me thinks the reaſon ſtandeth more ſtrongly againſt them; for as from that, Leuit. 19. 15. <hi>Thou ſhalt not fauour the poore in iudgement;</hi> A man may implie a portion from the ſtronger, that hee muſt then much leſſe fauour the rich. So here thou maiſt not doe any worke of thine ordinary voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the Sabbath, which yet at other times thou art commaunded to doe: then much leſſe maiſt thou doe the workes which no where are required of thee, but onely by way of permiſſion are at ſometimes allowed. And ſurely if you marke it, you ſhall finde more danger in theſe of the laſt ſort, than in the other: for that they more carrie away the minde from God, than theſe of our ordinarie vocation doe: for who is it that had not rather goe to Church, than goe to work? but who is it (I ſpeake of the multitude) that had not rather goe to play, than goe to Church? But when then (will ſome one demaund) ſhall wee haue time for recreation, if not vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath? If thou wilt haue time for that, allow part
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:20637:59"/> of thine owne, for that is thy worke, and therfore thou muſt allow part of thy time to doe it in, but Gods time thou maiſt not, for that he hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued for his owne buſineſſe. Let me aske thee one queſtion; If thou ſhouldeſt allow vnto thy ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thy ſixe daies, fiue whole daies to do his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and to recreate himſelfe in them, and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt reſerue vnto thy ſelfe but one; wouldeſt thou take it well at his hands, if thou chiding him for neglect of thy buſineſſe vpon that day, he ſhould anſwer, when ſhould I vſe recreation if not now? Which anſwere if thou wilt not take at thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants hands, doeſt thou thinke that God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it at thine, that hath dealt more liberallie with thee than thou with thy ſeruant? And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out vpon it, that thou ſhouldeſt offer this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him vpon his Sabbath, to pleade thus for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and recreation, when yet in truth all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations in the world cannot be anſwerable vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the recreations of the Sabbath: for what can recreate or refreſh a man more, than to drinke of the waters of life? What can glad a man more than to heare of the forgiuenes of his ſinnes? To one that is in priſon faſt bound in fetters, what greater recreation than to heare of his inlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and what greater comfort than to come vnto the ſealing of his pardon? And are theſe things offered vnto vs vpon the Sabbath, and yet doe we like children runne after butterflies, and let theſe things alone? If wee doe, it well ſhewes that ſince we were created we neuer were yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created and borne againe: for if we were, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioying
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:20637:59"/> of theſe things would be vnto vs aboue all the recreations in the world.</p>
                  <p>But then here it will be demaunded of me, <note place="margin">Not al recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at all times vpon the Sabbath vnlawfull.</note> whether I doe vtterly diſallow all recreations vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sabbath. Not ſo neither; for it may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times come ſo to paſſe, that recreation may bee more neceſſarie for a man than his meate, (as alſo it may ſo fall in the weeke daies) yea, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſetling of a mans minde free (ſuch is partly the corruption and partly the weaknes of our nature) may bee a furtherance vnto vs in the performance of the duties of godlineſſe, as well as in other duties of our owne. And therefore ſo farre foorth as it is either of neceſſitie for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent preſeruation of our health, or of neceſſitie for the preſent furtherance and fitting of vs vnto the ſeruice of God, we may vſe it. But by this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, will ſome ſay, euill men will take liberty vnto themſelues vnder theſe pretences to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane the Sabbath by their ſports. Anſw. It may well be ſo, that they which ſtumble at Chriſt to their ruine; and they that wreſt his word to their owne condemnation; will alſo wreſt this libertie to bring themſelues into the bondage of ſinne: yet muſt not this let vs, to giue that allowance vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Gods children which hee hath left him in his word. But as for ſuch as abuſe their libertie, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh them in the feare of God, that they make not Gods commandements like cheuerell laces, to ſtretch them euery waie to their owne bents and purpoſes. For if they doe, I appeale vnto the higheſt Iudge of all the earth, that they haue no
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:20637:60"/> ſuch libertie giuen them. And therefore if they take it, their blood bee vpon their owne heads, if they bring themſelues by their libertie to bee the ſonnes of bondage. But as for the children of God, I know they will and ſhall <hi>finiſh their ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with feare and trembling.</hi> And thus wee haue ſeene how theſe workes of recreations are alſo forbidden vs vpon the Sabbath.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>2</label> The third ſort of workes which are here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden vs, are our ſports, which commonly wee <note place="margin">Paſtimes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull vpon the Sabbath.</note> call paſtimes; which indeed though they be but recreations in their owne nature, yet as wine by his long ſtanding becommeth vineger; ſo doe theſe ſports and recreations by the exceſſiue vſe, or rather abuſe of them, become ſinfull: that is, when wee vſe them not to make our ſelues there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by fit to redeeme time, which the Apoſtle requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, but rather to ſpend time and vainely to paſſe it. And therefore if the former were vnlawfull which did after a ſort build vp a man; then how much more theſe that deſtroy a man, who by the exceſſiue vſe of them is made vnfit vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of any duties? of which ſort of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes are ſtage-plaies, cards and dice-playing vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Sabbath; as alſo Beare-baitings, Cock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and ſuch like. All which in particular to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute were infinite, the myſterie of vanitie is ſo large. Yet there is one aboue the reſt, (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſo much troubleth the miniſterie of the word, and becauſe it hath gotten her a whoriſh forehead, ſo that though we haue ſpit 7. times in her face, yet ſhe bluſheth not, but walketh like a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:20637:60"/> daughter of Sion with a ſtretched out necke, and a wandring eye, mincing it, and making a tinck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with her feete as ſhe goeth) me thinks I haue named her already (it is wanton dancing); I can not chuſe but ſpeake of it, the rather becauſe ſhe is degenerated ſo much from that manlike kind of actiuitie, and nimblenes, into a nice and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minace wantonnes; as alſo becauſe ſhe ſeemeth now to get her a ſhelter and couering vnder the lap of <hi>Dauids</hi> garment: Did not <hi>Dauid</hi> (ſay they) dance? True, but yet <hi>Dauid</hi> did not thus daunce as they now doe. For firſt, it was in thoſe times extraordinary, and not vſed, vnles <hi>vpon ſome great deliuerance,</hi> as <hi>when the damſels met Dauid and Saul in a daunce,</hi> 1. Sam. 18. 6: or <hi>vpon ſome great reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing,</hi> as <hi>at the bringing home of the Arke,</hi> 2. Sam. 6. But as for our dauncing, there is nothing ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon as it: no ſooner can the fidler ſound, but ſtraight we fall a frisking, as if wee had neuer felt our feete before that day. Secondly, <hi>Dauid daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before the Lord,</hi> 1. Sam. 6. 14. that is, to glorifie him; we before our mates, with whom we ſeeke to grace our ſelues. Thirdly, <hi>Dauid</hi> daunced <hi>to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſe and humble himſelfe; I will yet</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be more vile than thus, and low in mine owne ſight,</hi> 2. Sam. 6. 22. But we daunce to aduance and ſet foorth our ſelues. Laſtly, <hi>Dauid</hi> daunced <hi>alone,</hi> as the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner amongſt them was, <hi>the men by themſelues, and the women by themſelues,</hi> Exod. 15. 20. <hi>Firſt Moſes and the children of Iſrael ſang and daunced,</hi> verſ. 1: then verſ. 20. <hi>Miriam the Propheteſſe came forth with a timbrell in her hand, and all the women followed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:20637:61"/> 
                     <hi>her, with timbrels and daunces, and they anſwered the men.</hi> And ſo 1. Sam. 18. 6. <hi>The women met Saul and Dauid ſinging and dauncing.</hi> But wee daunce promiſcuouſly men and women together, nay good and bad together (if peraduenture there be any good amongſt them.) Theſe differences then I ſee not how any man is able to make to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: which if he cannot, he can no more iuſtly alleage his example to prooue our wanton dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing by, than if he ſhould bring the coniunction of man and woman in Paradiſe, to prooue the coniunction of them in the ſtewes lawfull: and therefore if any ſhall draw any dart out of <hi>Dauids</hi> quiuer, I doubt not but I ſhall be able to returne the point vpon himſelfe; as <hi>Amos</hi> vpon thoſe that alleaged <hi>Dauids</hi> example for the inuenting of inſtruments of muſicke to this purpoſe, allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging that they did it <hi>like Dauid,</hi> or <hi>as Dauid did:</hi> but though they held out <hi>Dauid</hi> for a buckler in this caſe, yet it would not beare off the woe hee pronounced againſt them, Amos 6. 5. Yea but, will they ſay, can I ſhew any place in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture where dauncing is expreſſely forbidden? no more can they ſhew me in the Scripture, where it is expreſſely forbidden a man ſhould robbe vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Salisbury plaine: yet he which ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteale,</hi> doth conſequently ſay, thou ſhalt not robbe vpon Salisburie plaine. And when as the Prophet <hi>Amos</hi> ſaith, that <hi>for three and for foure abominations God would not turne vnto Damaſcus;</hi> he ſaith as much as if hee had ſaid <hi>for ſeuen abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations;</hi> ſo when God forbiddeth <hi>wantonneſſe,</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="tcp:20637:61"/> Rom. 13. 13. when he forbiddeth <hi>fooliſh,</hi> nay <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant ieſting,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> Ephe. 5. 4; doth he not then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid our <hi>wanton and pleaſant dauncing?</hi> You will ſay, dauncing is not wantonnes, though wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes bee in dauncing. Be it ſo, becauſe it pleaſeth you thus to runne betweene the barke and the rinde; yet I perceiue that the bodie is ſicke that hath ſuch euils accompanying it, and I feare me when you ſhall ſeeke to ſunder dauncing from euill (I ſpeake of it as it is commonly vſed) you ſhall finde them like <hi>thornes folded one in another,</hi> that will hardly be ſundred. But be it ſo that dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing is but a thing indifferent; yet for my part I haue alwaies been of this minde in things indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, not to fetch the good or euill of them from their nature, but from the vſe or abuſe of them. I know well it cannot be denied, but that wine is good in it owne nature, but yet wee giue it not to one that is ſicke of a feuer, not for that it is naught, but for that it agreeth not with the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die ſo affected. It is no good ſtanding for one that hath a giddie head vpon a pinacle, that is no fit place for ſuch a one: Pleaſure is not comely for a foole, Pro. 19. 10; and ambitious men we ſay are not fit for honour, becauſe after too much deſire followes abuſe; and a man that is very thirſtie of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes drinketh till he bee drunken: therefore in reſpect of the great deſire that is in many of this, ſo farre as they know no meane in it, on the vſe there followeth abuſe, and they <hi>adde drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to thirſt;</hi> as the Prophet ſpeaketh: And this (as I take it) was the reaſon why God would not
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:20637:62"/> permit <hi>Lot</hi> to ſee the ſmoake of Sodome, becauſe he delighted in the ſoyle too much; which yet he granted vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> a man not ſo addicted thereunto. Young heads for the moſt part (which are the greateſt dauncers) are ſo vnruly and wai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, by reaſon of the corruption wherewith they are warmed in their mothers wombes, as that they turne grace it ſelfe many times into wantonnes; how much more will they turne this dalliance into further wantonnes? A ſafer way therefore ſhall be to keepe them and it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder. For, caſt a coale into flaxe, or a ſparkle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tinder, or a burning match into gunpowder, bring fire into the winde, and you ſhall ſee how eaſily it burneth and bloweth vp all. Now as the coale is vnto the flaxe, a ſparkle vnto tinder, a match to powder, winde to the fire; ſo are theſe ſports to their nature, which is as ſoone ſet on fire, as flaxe, or tinder, or gunpowder. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the rule which the Wiſe man giueth to ſuch as are wantonly giuen, Pro. 5. 8. that they <hi>come not neere the doore of an harlot.</hi> He ſpeaketh, me thinks, as though the plague or ſome infection were in the houſe, which wee vſe to auoide: I ſay not all that goe vnto them be naught; but yet let them take heede of the infection. And I thinke verely that theſe Sommer-houſes and May-poles may deſerue more iuſtly to haue plague-bils written vpon them, than any houſe that is infected with the plague: for the infection and plague of ſinne is greater in them than in theſe. Said he well that ſaid, <hi>Haue no fellowſhip with the vnfruitfull workes of</hi>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:20637:62"/> 
                     <hi>darknes?</hi> Epheſ. 5. 21. By workes of darknes hee meanes the workes of euill men, as appeareth verſ. 8. <hi>Ye were once darknes.</hi> Now that it is a worke of euill men, appeareth, in that the worſt men for the moſt part moſt deſire it, and that it is vnfruitfull (I meane as touching any fruite vnto godlineſſe) who ſeeth not, ſeeing no man is made the better, the wiſer, the holier, or more religious thereby. No man is drawne thereby to reforme any euill in himſelfe, no corruption reprooued, no ſin abated, no repentance wrought, no feare: Seeing then <hi>no grapes grow on theſe thornes, nor figs vpon theſe thiſtles;</hi> but that as the tree is, ſo is his fruite, and as his fruite is ſo is the tree: it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that as the Apoſtle willeth, wee <hi>haue no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with theſe vnfruitfull works of darknes, but rather reprooue them.</hi> Which wee ſhall the ſooner doe, if wee conſider how diſagreeing they are with the profeſſion of a Chriſtian, who is willed <hi>to be ſober, to gird vp the loynes of his minde,</hi> Luk. 17. <hi>to crucifie the fleſh with the luſts thereof,</hi> Galath. 5. 24. <hi>to ſeeke thoſe things which are aboue,</hi> Coloſſ. 3. 2. All which, or any one, how doth a Chriſtian practiſe in his wanton dauncing? But were there no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons but this one, that it is offenſiue vnto good men, and eſpecially vnto Gods miniſters; it ought to bee left. For as the Apoſtle <hi>would neuer eate meate while the world ſtood, rather than hee would of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his brother;</hi> ſo doubtleſſe, had they the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles minde that vſe it, they <hi>would neuer daunce whileſt they liue, rather than they would offend their brethren.</hi> Indeede were it a dutie that were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:20637:63"/> then they were to doe it whoſoeuer ſaid to the contrarie; and <hi>the offence was not giuen but taken,</hi> but being a thing indifferent, which wee may doe or not, we ought to leaue it, in that our brethren are offended at it. And yet further to ſhew the euils of dauncing, I might alleage the euill of the puniſhment that is oftentimes vpon them. Firſt in their bodies, by their vnmeaſurable toyle, aches, ſurfets, and ſo conſequently deadly feuers; are ingendred; in their ſoules, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they haue compoſed and ordered in the day or time before, they ſhall finde it all troubled and out of courſe; in their goods, a thriftleſſe and prodigall waſting and ſpending of them; as alſo loſſe of their time, that can neuer be recouered. If they thinke that I ſpeake not the truth herein, let them no more but when they lie downe vpon their beds examine their own conſciences, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it he not ſo. As alſo oftentimes, the wrath of God lighting vpon them in the middeſt of their ſports. In a daunce the daughters of Shilo were all defloured, Iudg. 21. 21. In a daunce the men of Siglag were all ſlaine, 1. Sam. 30. 16. Whileſt the Iſraelites daunced about the calfe, the wrath of God grew hot amongſt them, Exod. 32. And <hi>Iob</hi> ſheweth how the wicked goe to hell in a daunce, Iob. 21. Is not all this ſufficient to prooue it euill<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if not, yet it is certaine that it hath an appearance of euill, and therefore wee muſt abſtaine from it. For 1. Theſſ. 5. 22. the Apoſtle willeth vs <hi>to abſtaine from all appearance of euill.</hi> But howſoeuer at other times it may be held (circumſtances conſidered)
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:20637:63"/> an exerciſe not ſo euill: yet vpon the Sabbath I will iuſtifie it to be a notable euill. Firſt, becauſe by this the reſt is broken, as farre foorth as by any other labour. Secondly, the minde is diſtracted and lead away to pleaſures, when as it ſhould bee wholy intent to Gods worſhip. But they ſerue God (will ſome ſay) although they daunce. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no more than they can goe two waies at once, or indite a letter, and tell a tale: no more can they minde their pleaſures and ſerue God too. It is Chriſts rule, <hi>a man cannot ſerue God and riches,</hi> no more can hee ſerue God and pleaſures. Yet my ſoule weepeth in ſecret, to ſee, that whereas God hath appointed his Sabbath to be ſanctified and kept holie, and his word then to bee taught; this wantonnes hath miſerably incroched vpon him, and taken his right, and part, and giuen it to ſports and paſtimes; to kiſſings and imbracings, and wrung his righteous ſcepter out of his hand, and giuen it vnto Lords of Miſrule, euen ſo farre foorth, that now the ſtriuing is for theſe things. For this ſinne of wantonnes hath ſet vp a monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie in the mindes of men, and beginneth now to ſtriue with God for his day: for <hi>when</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſhould we do theſe things if not vpon the Sondaies?</hi> But as for the preaching of the word, catechiſing and inſtruction, theſe are but the leſſer things of the law, they are but mint and cummin; but the great things of the Sabbath are their ſports; though God requireth that his kingdome ſhould firſt be ſought, and that all other buſineſſes and delights too, ſhould be ſet aſide for his ſeruice. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:20637:64"/> as here he diſpenſeth with our workes for a day, ſo 1. Cor. 7. 4. he diſpenſeth with the very du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of mariage it ſelfe for a time, that the married may giue themſelues to prayer: yea Ioel. 2. 15. he calleth the bride and the bridegroome out of their bed chamber, who though hee would not haue ſundred the firſt yeere, for any affaires of warre, yet they muſt come foorth into the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie: and doth hee not then call vs much more from theſe fooliſh vanities? Will he reſtraine the bride, and the bridegroome, from delighting one in anothers loue for a ſeaſon, that his ſeruice may be performed? and will he then (thinke you) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low theſe fooliſh vanities vpon the Sabbath? Of which I may ſay as <hi>Ionah; They that waite vpon them forſake their owne mercie,</hi> Ion. 2. 8. But you wil ſay, all doe not this. Tell not me what ſome doe not, but tell me what the moſt part doe: to proue a diſeaſe contagious, it is ſufficient to ſhew that many bee infected by it, and in matters of perill what commeth often, not alwaies to paſſe; though in this I dare ſay, it fareth as in a common plague, in which it is no wonder to ſee many die, but it is a wonder to ſee any eſcape the infection. For ſhew me almoſt one that is a common daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, that preferreth not his pleaſure before Gods ſeruice. Yea but, you will ſay, be it that dauncing is euill, yet were not a man better to daunce vpon the Sabbath, than to doe worſe? Anſw. Firſt, I would know of ſuch whether there be a neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie laid vpon them to doe naught? muſt they needes doe this, or elſe will they doe worſe? Are
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:20637:64"/> they <hi>Ieremies</hi> Negroes that neuer wil be waſhed white? And <hi>haue they ſo accuſtomed themſelues to do euill that they can doe no good?</hi> Iere. 13. 23. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if it be ſo, I would know of them becauſe they will do bad, or elſe they will doe worſe; whether the Magiſtrate muſt therefore ſuffer them to doe bad? were it not to giue the way vnto all ſinne and iniquitie? But thirdly, how in this reaſoning is goodneſſe and badneſſe tied by the tailes like <hi>Sampſons</hi> foxes, to worke miſchiefe withall? Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (doe you ſay) to doe this, than to doe worſe? Indeede I know that of euils ſome are worſe than others; but for their degrees in goodneſſe I think of them as of the foxes whelpes, <hi>there is neuer a better:</hi> for there is neuer a good; but they bee all naught. And therefore this thou maiſt truly ſay, it is not ſo bad to doe this, as to doe worſe: but this cannot iuſtifie the doing of either. Indeede we vſe to ſay of euils, the leaſt muſt be choſen; but if the euils bee ſinnes, then I ſay of euils neither muſt bee choſen. And therefore this is a fooliſh kinde of reaſoning to iuſtifie euill by worſe; as whoredome by the ſtewes. Tell me if a theefe ſhould ſet vpon thee in the way, and ſhould vſe this argument: Sir, it is better to robbe you, than to kill you, and therefore giue me your purſe; wouldeſt thou be ſo ſheepiſh, vnleſſe he brought club arguments to beate thee downe with, to yeeld thy purſe? or if thou diddeſt let him haue thy purſe; might he not be hanged for all his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicke?

Then as if ſome man had anſwered him, <hi>that doe I,</hi> he preſently directeth him what he ſhall doe; <hi>Keepe thy tongue from euill,</hi> ſaith he, Pſal. 34.

And it hath indeed great neede to be kept; <hi>for death and life are in the power of the tongue,</hi> Prou. 18. 21. But as it muſt be kept in all the commandements, ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue all in this commandement: becauſe in any one vaine or ſinfull ſpeech vpon the Sabbath, we ſinne twice: firſt, againſt the commaundement that forbids that ſinne: ſecondly, in that it is a breach of the holineſſe of the Sabbath.

                  <p>Vnder the like condemnation alſo come all thoſe that vpon the Sabbath talke of nothing but their pleaſures and ſports, that rehearſe and tell nothing but goſſips tales, and newes, that loue to haue their tongues to runne through the world, and to be medling in other mens matters; if any queſtion ſhall be put as concerning religion, they grow as mute as fiſhes.

And therefore as other thy workes are here for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden which are ſeruile, becauſe they hinder holineſſe; ſo theſe kinde of ſeruile workes aboue all others are forbidden, becauſe they not onely hinder holineſſe, but are oppoſite vnto it, ſo farre foorth as hee which is ſubiect vnto them is free from holineſſe, Rom. 6. 20.

I know well this reſt from our ſinnes muſt bee kept in the whole courſe of

And that he meaneth ſo, appeareth in that which he preſently addeth. But <hi>if thou doeſt not well</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſin lieth at the doore:</hi> thereby putting it out of doubt, that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:20637:68"/> if a good thing be not well done, it is ſinne; and in regard hereof it is that Eſai. chap. 58. <hi>reckoneth the hypocrite a Sabbath-breaker,</hi> though hee did humble himſelfe by faſting, &amp;c. And therefore let the hypocrite and popiſh meritmonger bee well aſſured, that though they digge deepe to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer their ſinnes, and diſſemble deeply with God at the Church; yet let them be well aſſured I ſay, that <hi>their owne ſinne will finde them out,</hi> Num. 32. 23. and that it will waite and tarrie them like their dogges at the doore, yea and will hunt them and neuer leaue them, vntill it haue brought them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to deſtruction, if they learne not to ſerue the Lord aright.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, as the ſoule muſt keep this Sabbath or reſt from ſin vpon this day eſpecially; ſo muſt we look alſo that our minds and thoughts be not carried away with the meditation of worldlie matters. For <hi>God requireth</hi> not onely thy bodie, <hi>but thy ſoule,</hi> yea <hi>thy very thoughts,</hi> Luk. 10. 27.

A man muſt not therefore buſie his head vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath about his worldly buſineſſe, nor about the effecting of his delights in the weeke following; but he muſt bee wholie as it were another man from that which he was in the weeke before; and he muſt vpon the Sabbath let fall the care of theſe earthly things, as <hi>Elias</hi> did his mantle, when hee was rapt vp into heauen.</p>

Of which meeting there is not onely mention made, 1. Cor. 11. 17, 18, but alſo the time ſet downe, <hi>euery firſt day of the weeke,</hi> 1. Cor. 16. 1.

This ſhould make thee to feare and quake, as it did <hi>Iacob</hi> at Bethel, that is, at the houſe of the Lord, if thou diddeſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. <hi>How fearefull is the place?</hi> ſaith <hi>Iacob.</hi> Surely <hi>it is none other but the houſe of God, and this is the gate of heauen.</hi> This (I ſay) if thou diddeſt conſider, would make thee to bee readie as <hi>Cornelius,</hi> to heare whatſoeuer is commaunded thee of God. But it befalleth to the moſt part of men as it befel to <hi>Iacob</hi> while he ſlept; <hi>The Lord was there, but he was not aware,</hi> Geneſ. 28. So the Lord is there, but they wiſt it not: they ſtand gazing about the Church, as if they ſhould be asked that queſtion when they come home, <hi>What went you to the Church to ſee?</hi> and not <hi>what to heare:</hi> their eyes are on euery one, ſaue on the teacher, on whom they ſhould be faſtned, as the peoples were on Chriſt, Luk. 4. 16: but as for the Preachers, though they ſit before them, yet as <hi>Phineas</hi> wife they neither aske nor regard, though they ſpeake comfortably vnto them. But doe theſe men thinke that God is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:20637:73"/> preſent? that they ſtand before his Angels? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they wiſt it not; if they did, they would not doe it. Neither would others ſo ſoundly ſleepe, as though the Preacher came to make their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall ſermon, if they wiſt that God were there; leaſt in his wrath hee ſhould make them ſleepe their laſt, and ſhould make them fall downe dead in the place, as he did <hi>Eutychus,</hi> for their propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Sabbath, Act. 20.</p>
                  <p>The next and laſt point is our continuance, <note place="margin">We muſt not depart before the publique exerciſe be ended.</note> which the Prince himſelfe is bound vnto. For <hi>the Prince ſhall be in the middeſt of them, he ſhall go in when they goe in, and when they goe foorth, they ſhall goe foorth together,</hi> Ezek. 46. 10. Neither yet was this a dutie other than became a King to doe; which made <hi>Dauid</hi> deſire to bee a doore-keeper in the houſe of the Lord. Now a doore-keeper is firſt in, and laſt out. Such a one (ſaith <hi>Dauid)</hi> would I bee in Gods houſe. Neither was <hi>Dauid</hi> alone in it, but the people. When <hi>Zachary</hi> ſaw a viſion in the Temple, though he ſtayed long, yet they waited for him, Luk. 1. 24. they would not depart without the bleſſing, which the Prieſt was to pronounce, Numb. 6. 24. We ſee in the Court great men will not depart without the Princes leaue; but out of Gods court euery whiſtle of pleaſure is ſufficient to call vs away: and it fareth with the Preacher oftentimes while hee is in the pulpit, as with Chriſt while hee wrote with his ſinger on the ground; they goe out one by one, till he be left alone: eſpecially if he chance a little to ſting them (as indeede if hee preach well his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:20637:73"/> words bee like goades, Eccl. 12. 11.) then vp they ſtart as if their ſeate had been ſhaken vnder them, and away they fling as if the ſtout had taken them. One moues this queſtion, what ſhould be the cauſe a man ſhould talk ſo long about world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly matters and neuer bee wearie; but in matters of godlineſſe ſhould ſo ſoone giue ouer? As for example, let a man reade a ſtorie he will ſit vp all night to reade it; and wee can ſit a whole after-noone and talke of nothing but of worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and neuer complaine of being wearie: ſo can wee ſpend whole daies and nights at cardes and dice and neuer giue ouer: But come wee vnto matters of religion, come we vnto a ſermon, goe we to prayer; good Lord what a buſineſſe is there to keepe open our eyes one houre, it is euen the very time of tediouſneſſe vnto vs; and wee think of ſuch a time as thoſe in <hi>Amos</hi> of the new Moone, Amos 8, which was the firſt day of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moneth: which they accounted as a whole moneth, <hi>When will the new Moone be gone,</hi> ſay they; as if the day had bin vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo long as a whole moneth. What is the reaſon of this? Surely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than knoweth well that if he let vs alone in theſe things, downe goeth his kingdome; therefore he ſetteth vpon vs as ſoone as may bee, and our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, which vnto good is leſſe than a will, but vnto euill more than a will, preſently like a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor giueth ouer any longer to reſiſt. Now to ſtay vs againſt theſe temptations, let vs bethink our ſelues when we are aſſailed by them, as <hi>Peter; Lord whither ſhall wee goe? thou haſt the words of eternall</hi>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>6</label> Now it remaineth that we intreate of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique duties themſelues, which are three: the firſt whereof is the preaching and publique reading <note place="margin">The word muſt be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched vpon the Sabbath.</note> of the word, being ſanctified by the publique prayers of the Church. The ſecond, the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments. And the third, diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline: of all which in order. And firſt, that the word is to bee preached vpon the Sabbath is eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, Act. 15. 21. in that <hi>Moſes had of old time in euery citie thoſe that preached him, ſeeing hee is read euery Sabbath in the Synagogue.</hi> For it was their manner after they had read it to giue the ſenſe, and cauſe the people to vnderſtand the reading, Nehe. 8. 8. And at Antiochia after the lecture of the Law and the Prophets, the Rulers of the Synagogue requeſted <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> to preach, Act. 13. 15. <hi>If yee haue any word of exhortation for the people, ſay on.</hi> And after they had taught the Iewes, <hi>the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles requested them to preach the ſame things the next Sabbath, which they did,</hi> verſ. 44. Yea and this Chriſt did ordinarily, for it was his cuſtome, Luk. 4. 16. Neither was it ordinary amongſt the Iewes onely, but <hi>at Troas the firſt day of the weeke</hi> (which is our Sabbath) <hi>they came together, and Paul prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:20637:74"/> 
                     <hi>vnto them,</hi> Act. 20. 7. And good reaſon that it ſhould be ſo: for if the word be the ſeede of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation whereby we are begotten againe, and wee cannot enter vnleſſe wee be borne againe, Ioh. 3; how can we be without it? If it be y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> milke whereby we are fed; how can we grow without it? 1. Pet. 2. 2. It is a queſtion that yet in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie of man was neuer aſſoiled, how a man might bee ſaued without the preaching of the word. For, <hi>how can wee beleeue in him of whom wee haue not heard? and how can we heare without a prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher?</hi> Rom. 10. 14. And therefore let them that hold faith and denie preaching, anſwere the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, and I will lay my hand vpon my mouth, and pleade no more for preaching: otherwiſe I cannot but hold it the ordinarie meanes vnto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; yea and ſuch a one, as that the world (though it count preaching fooliſhnes) cannot be ſaued without it, 1. Cor. 1. 12. Indeed ſome ſay, is not reading of the Scriptures and Homilies as good as preaching? Indeed they are good we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie not, and a good meanes alſo to ſaluation; yet not matchable with the word preached: which if they might be thought ſo in the iudgement of men, yet muſt wee not appoint God meanes by which he ſhall ſaue vs. But you will ſay, the word may be preached at ſome other time. I graunt it; but then much more on the Sabbath, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet apart thereunto, and his bleſſing being moſt vpon his owne ordinance; wee ought moſt to expect it vpon that day.</p>
                  <p>But as by this it appeareth that the Miniſter is
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:20637:75"/> bound to teach, ſo on the Sabbath the people are <note place="margin">The people are bound to heare the word vpon the Sabbath.</note> bound to heare. For hee that ſaith, <hi>the Prieſts lips ſhould preſerue knowledge;</hi> ſaith alſo that <hi>the people muſt ſeeke the law at his mouth,</hi> Mal. 2. Yea the King himſelfe is bound thereunto, although the diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his affaires might ſeeme to let him. And therefore away with theſe excuſes; It is too farre, it is too ſoone, it is too late, it is too cold, it is too hot; euery excuſe will eaſily let vs; and wee can better away with it to ſit at cards on the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath by a hot fire, than to ſit at a Sermon with God in a cold church. Tuſh, it is enough to ſerue God in the fore-noone; but to ſerue him againe in the after-noone is too much: though in the law <hi>the ſacrifices were doubled that day,</hi> Num. 28. yet now to go twice to the ſeruice and ſermon is too much holineſſe. But whileſt wee will not be too holy, wee are groſly fooliſh and prophane, kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping back halfe, as <hi>Ananias,</hi> when God requires the whole.</p>
                  <p>Yea but the world was neuer ſo bad as ſince <note place="margin">Obiections remoued.</note> there was ſo much preaching, and there are none ſo bad as they that runne after ſermons. Indeede theſe are the voices of them that haue ſold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to worke wickedneſſe: and it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueile to heare them diſclaime preaching; for they whoſe eyes are ſore crie out againſt the light; yet is there no fault in the light, but their eies be bad: ſo is it with theſe men, they are euill themſelues, but <hi>the word is good,</hi> Eſay 49. 8. And therfore they crie out againſt it, becauſe as the light it maketh all things manifeſt; and therfore it is as welcome
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:20637:75"/> amongſt them, as a torch is amongſt a companie of the eues, which they willingly labor to put out, leaſt their dealings ſhould bee eſpied; ſo true is that which our Sauiour ſaith; <hi>Euery one that euill doth hateth the light, neither commeth to the light, leaſt their deedes ſhould be reprooued,</hi> Ioh. 3. 20. And this is the cauſe why the Papiſts, and the Atheiſts are ſo much againſt the word; becauſe it maketh their dealings to be ſeene: therefore they put out the light, that they may ſinne the more greedily in the darke. Secondly, I anſwere as the Apoſtle reaſoneth; <hi>What if ſinne ſhall take an occaſion by the law to be more ſinfull; ſhall we therfore blame the law? God forbid.</hi> So, if iniquitie hath neuer been ſo rife, as now it is in the rifenes of the Goſpell; ſhall we lay the fault vpon the Goſpell? we may not doe it, no more than the Apoſtle might vpon the law; for it is moſt certaine, the <hi>word is as a light vnto our feete,</hi> and it ſheweth vs what is the will of our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. Now whether thinke you is more likely to ſtumble, he that ſeeth, or hee that is blinde? and whether is likelier to doe his maſters buſineſſe, hee that knowes his will, or he that is ignorant of it. Thirdly, I ſee not how it may come to paſſe that men ſhould be the worſe for preaching. For doth the preacher teach it? or doth hee not crie out againſt ſinne, againſt adulterie, oathes, Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, oppreſſion, and ſuch like? Theſe cockle and weedes are none of their planting: they ſow good ſeede, faith in Chriſt, repentance from dead workes, &amp;c. But will you know how this commeth to paſſe? looke Matth. 13. 28. <hi>The</hi>
                     <pb n="134" facs="tcp:20637:76"/> 
                     <hi>enuious man hath done it;</hi> the Ieſuite hath done it; the Papiſt hath done it; the Atheiſt hath done it; the Diuell the father of them all hath done it: for this is their cockle and darnell that they haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen amongſt the wheate; and theſe are they that make men <hi>two-fold more the children of hell than they were before.</hi> Laſtly, as for thoſe that truly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Goſpell, howſoeuer they may and doe a thouſand times condemne themſelues of ſinne before the Lord, and go mourning and hanging downe their heads that it is ſo; yet they may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily compare with theſe Blackamoores, theſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and Atheiſts, that haue nothing white be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their teeth. And therefore I conclude with <hi>Salomon,</hi> Eccl. 7. 12. <hi>Say not that former times are better than theſe, for then thou doeſt not wiſely.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, for it is certaine that ſinne was as rife here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore as now; but not ſo much ſeene: for then they liued in blindneſſe and ignorance, whereas now they liue in the ſunſhine of the Goſpell. Now, let a man come into a houſe at midnight, he ſeeth nothing out of order: but let him come in at midday, he ſhall eſpie many faults. So in the time of Poperie, wee liued in darkneſſe, euen as groſſe as that of Egypt, we could not then (as we ſay) ſee the wood for trees, nor know ſin for ſin: all almoſt was veniall, or rather commendable, (for the Maſſe an abominable Idoll was counted the higheſt point of religion:) but now the Sun is riſen, we ſee things to be as they are: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore howſoeuer they blame preaching; yet muſt wee lay holde vpon it, as the light that muſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:20637:76"/> guide vs through this world full of daungers.</p>
                  <p>But, will ſome ſay, we haue not the word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched where wee are. The more is the pitie: but what ſhall we doe in the meane time? wee muſt doe as beggers, wee muſt ſeeke it, the law can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reſtraine them but they will begge rather than they will ſtarue. Or elſe as it was ſaid of the people of God in the famine, that <hi>they ſighed and ſought their bread, and gaue their pleaſant things for meate,</hi> Lament. 1. So muſt you, the ſoule being more worth than the body; ye muſt doe ſo much for the ſoule at leaſt, as yee would for the bodie. Giue then your pleaſant things for meate. How many Miniſters ſtand idle, I ſay not in the market place, but in the Vniuerſities, that no man hath hired; ſend for them, ſhew your ſelues chriſtians, <hi>honour God with your riches,</hi> Prou. 3. 9. <hi>let him haue the firſt fruites of your increaſe.</hi> The Iſraelites for their Calfe <hi>plucked off their earings and frontiles;</hi> and <hi>Michah</hi> hired a Leuite for his Teraphim at his owne charge. And ſhall theſe Idolaters riſe in iudgement to condemne you? But the coſt would be great. But if it were a greater matter, were it to haue thy fourth, againſt thy neighbor thou wouldeſt beſtow it; and wilt thou not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow ſo much to doe him good? no, nor thy ſelfe neither? Out vpon that money and that treaſure that ſhall lie and ruſt by thee, when thou ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt diſpend it to the aduantage of thy ſoule; the ruſt of it ſhall beare witneſſe againſt thee in the day of vengeance; and then what will it aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage thee to haue a fat purſe, and a leane ſoule?
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:20637:77"/> 
                     <hi>Buy therefore</hi> (now whileſt thou maiſt) <hi>the truth, but ſell it not; buy the field where the treaſure is.</hi> The good Merchant will doe ſo; be thou therefore the good Merchant, thou canſt be no loſer by it: and therefore buy it. And this much touching the firſt publike dutie, namely the preaching and hearing of the word.</p>

And if the very hemme of his garment had vertue to heale vncurable diſeaſes; how much more ſhall this his bodie heale vs, if we be truly partakers of it? But ſurely for ſuch as take it onely by conſtraint and compulſion, well they may finde the cloathes where Chriſt his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die was, but not his bodie. And becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it not worthily, and with comfort, but of conſtraint, therefore in ſteed of a ſeale of his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, they may receiue a pledge of his wrath. And ſo much for the ſecond dutie.</p>

Now, many men when they haue bin at Church, they thinke they may doe all the reſt of the day what they liſt; <hi>As the harlot when ſhe had payed her vowes, ſhe thought ſhe might play the harlot,</hi> Prou. 7.

But they muſt know that God doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the whole day to be ſpent in holy duties. And therefore as thou maiſt in no part of the day breake the reſt by labour; ſo much leſſe maiſt thou breake the holineſſe: for God commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the one aſwell as the other; holineſſe aſwell as reſt: nay reſt ſhould not haue been commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but for holineſſe. And therefore as I haue ſhewed before it was a ſin to breake the reſt, ſo is it much more to breake the Sabbath, by omitting the duties of holineſſe. Indeed thou art not tied to ſpend the whole day in the publique exerciſes
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:20637:78"/> before mentioned, neither were the Iewes: for they had but their ſacrifice euening and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, Numb. 28. and prayers with their ſacrifice, as appeareth Luk. 1. 10, in that the people prayed whileſt the incenſe was a burning. Then they had a lecture of the Law and Prophets, Act. 13. 15: after that preaching. For when they had read the Law, <hi>they gaue the ſenſe thereof, and cauſed the people to vnderſtand the reading,</hi> Nehem. 8. 8; and then thankſgiuing.

But yet the interim, before, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt, and after, was ſpent either in priuate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of godlineſſe, or elſe in theſe which are both priuate and publique; which are therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and obſerued in the practiſe of the Church, that wee might draw them alſo into imitation: which being at other times of the weeke to bee done, ſo much more were they on the Sabbath: and the exerciſes of religion being vpon that day doubled, Numb. 28; why ſhould God bee now leſſe ſerued vnder the Goſpell, than hee was vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law?</p>

Therfore <hi>when Zachary was burning of incenſe within, the people were in prayer without,</hi> Luk. 1. 10: which as it muſt bee done in the morning; ſo alſo at night. For <hi>Dauid would haue his prayer as the incenſe,</hi> which was the firſt thing the Prieſt did when hee came into the Temple: and <hi>the lifting vp of his hands as the euen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice,</hi> Pſal. 142. which was on the Sabbath at night offered: ſo muſt our prayers be. It ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth me the more to marueile at ſome kinde of men that thinke if they haue been at ſeruice (as they call it) in the fore-noone, that God is behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto them for that; and that they are not bound to returne againe in the after-noone: but that they conſecrate vnto ſome paſtimes, as though they had been at Church in the morning to aske God leaue to goe to play in the after-noone. Now as this is a publique exerciſe of the Sabbath, and muſt go before and after the word, ſo alſo at other times; or elſe why are wee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded <hi>to pray continually?</hi> 1.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>3</label> The ſecond exerciſe that is both priuate and publique is the reading of the Scriptures: which <note place="margin">2. Reading of the Sriptures.</note> appeareth in that Chriſt willeth vs to <hi>ſearch the Scriptures:</hi> and Matth. 12. <hi>Haue you not read in the law?</hi> as though wee were bound to reade it. And in very truth the King himſelfe is bound to doe it, Deut. 17. 19. Which wee will yet doe ſo much the ſooner, if we conſider that <hi>he is bleſſed that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</hi> &amp;c. Reu. 1. 2. Which reaſons lead the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reans, Act. 17. 11. when they had heard <hi>Paul,</hi> to ſee <hi>whether it were ſo or no.</hi> And as we muſt reade the word in priuate, ſo muſt it be read in publique. <hi>Paul would haue his Epiſtle read in the Church of Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea,</hi> Coloſſ. 4. 16. And Nehem. 8. the Prieſts firſt read the law, and then afterwards gaue the ſenſe. So Act. 13. they <hi>had a lecture of the law.</hi> And Act. 15. <hi>Moſes was preached ſeeing he was read.</hi> Now, it may be, many would reade; but as the woman anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chriſt when hee would drinke, <hi>thou haſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to draw;</hi> ſo they would reade, but they haue no bookes. Of thoſe that come to the aſſemblie,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:20637:80"/> how many can reade? I miſtake, I would ſay of thoſe that can reade, how many haue bookes? If a man haue taken a peece of ground, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer quiet, til he haue his leaſe or coppie or deeds. If he doubt in any clauſe, he will either looke in it himſelfe, or goe to him that can reade. But in theſe things wee paſſe not; wee thinke wee ſhall ſtumble vpon ſaluation well enough, though we neuer ſeek it. It is reported of the Iewes that they <note place="margin">Ioſephus.</note> knew the Scriptures as well as their owne names; but amongſt vs many ſcarce know the names of the Scriptures. When a booke is named they know not where to finde it. This was the policie of popiſh times, to keep the people in ignorance; hauing herein followed the policie of the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines, who becauſe they would keepe the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites in ſlauerie, would not allow the vſe of any weapons vnto them, <hi>(Ionathan</hi> and his Armour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer, and <hi>Saul,</hi> onely excepted, whom forſooth they would ſeeme to grace) nor permit a Smith among them: the reaſon was, leaſt they ſhould make them ſwords: and as for their tooles they muſt come downe to the Philiſtines to ſharpen them. So deale the Papiſts, they claſpe vp the book of God in an vnknowne tongue, and wreſt out of lay mens hands the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word. Onely they vouchſafe it to ſome few of their faction, for a miſchiefe: but as for the people, they muſt come downe to the Popes Decrees, and Church-traditions, vnwrit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten truths, and vntrue writings; and there they muſt ſharpen their tooles: but Smith muſt they
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20637:80"/> haue none, no Preacher, leaſt hee make them ſwords.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but they will ſay, many grow into errors by reading of the word. Anſw. Firſt, I know no greater hereſie than Poperie, that is an hereſie of hereſies. Secondly, if this bee a good reaſon, that becauſe many abuſe it, therefore others may not vſe it; I ſee not but that men muſt forſake their meate and drinke alſo, becauſe ſome be drunken, and ſome ſurfet. So the Sacrament ſhould be ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, becauſe <hi>ſome receiue it to their condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> Nay, ſo the word, yea Chriſt himſelfe ſhould not be receiued, becauſe <hi>he is put for the fall of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> Luk. 2. They muſt therefore know, that in things indifferent in themſelues, though the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe doth take away the vſe; yet not ſo in things commanded vs: yea, but ſhall we <hi>giue holy things to dogges?</hi> No; but will you withhold the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens bread, becauſe the dogs catch at it? Should a Captaine, becauſe ſome be alwaies quarelling, ſtabbing and killing, therefore preſentlie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund that all his ſouldiers ſhould lay aſide their weapons? No, but rather that they take armes to beate downe the quarellers. And ſo wee ſay that <hi>the wearing of weapons breedes peace,</hi> and ſo muſt we vſe our ſpirituall weapons: but whereas they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a feare of running into errors, God hath promiſed to giue his ſpirit vnto his that ſhal leade them into all truth; and better they cannot bee lead than by the word: for that is a glaſſe where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a man may ſee what is amiſſe. Friends dare not tell a man his faults, for feare of diſpleaſing. Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:20637:81"/> will not. But reade the word, and thou ſhalt ſee there is no fault which thou haſt committed in all thy life, but either <hi>Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Dauid,</hi> or <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> or one of the Prophets, or of the Apoſtles, will tell thee of it. And therefore being that reading ſhewes a man his error; how can it be that it ſhould bring him into error. And ſo much for the ſecond dutie that is mixt.</p>

Catechiſme</note> ſelfe is a wonder: yet in the word taught moſt plainly. Hebr. 6. 1, the firſt principles of religion are called <hi>the foundation,</hi> and the teaching of them <hi>the laying of the foundation,</hi> and there he rehearſeth vp certaine principles, as <hi>repentance, faith, baptiſme.</hi> Now that to catechiſe is required, both priuately and publiquely, and that as at all other times, ſo eſpecially vpon the Sabbath I will make to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare. And firſt that it ought to be performed in priuate is euident, becauſe that all which haue vnderſtanding are bound to teach others: Heb. 5. 12. the Apoſtle blameth them <hi>for that when as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time they ought to bee teachers, they had</hi>
                     <pb n="146" facs="tcp:20637:82"/> 
                     <hi>neede themſelues to be taught the firſt principles.</hi> And 1. Pet. 4. 10. <hi>Let euery man as he hath receiued the gift, miniſter one to another:</hi> but yet more ſpecially this is required at the Miniſters hand in the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and at the parents and maſters hand in the houſe. That it behoueth the Miniſter to cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſe, appeareth in that he is not onely required to be diligent <hi>to know the ſtate of his flocke,</hi> Pro. 27. 23, but much more <hi>to feede it,</hi> 1. Pet. 5. 1. and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to <hi>feede the ſheepe,</hi> Ioh. 21. 16. but firſt to feede <hi>the lambes,</hi> ibid. verſ. 15. And that Chriſt requireth them to doe euen <hi>as they loue him,</hi> verſ. 17. which made <hi>Paul</hi> to doe it <hi>openly, and from houſe to houſe,</hi> Act. 20. 20. And this hee did continually: and therfore out of queſtion vpon the Sabbath. And to doe this is the Miniſters dutie; for <hi>the loue of Chriſt inforceth them,</hi> 2. Pet. 1. 12, 13. And that this dutie may take the better effect, husbands and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and maſters muſt doe the ſame. The huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band muſt doe it: therefore their wiues are ſent to ſchoole vnto them, they muſt <hi>learne of their husband at home,</hi> 1. Corinth. 14. 35: then their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands muſt teach them. Parents muſt doe it; for they muſt <hi>bring vp their children in the nurtriture of the Lord,</hi> Epheſ. 6. 4. And Deut. 6. 7. <hi>Thou ſhalt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſe theſe words continually vnto thy children, &amp;c. Continually,</hi> for it muſt be <hi>precept vpon precept.</hi> For children come not vnto grace at an inſtance; but by degrees. They are like narrow mouthed cups; a man cannot powre in all at once into them: but a man muſt teach them as Chriſt taught his followers, <hi>as they were able to heare,</hi> Mar. 4. 33: or as

                     <hi>Iacob</hi> draue his cattell <hi>according vnto their pace.</hi> And although I now ſaid that wiues muſt learne of their husbands; yet wiues muſt teach their children. Tit. 2. 3. it is required of a woman that ſhe be <hi>a teacher of good things.</hi> And Prou. 31. it is ſaid, <hi>the law of grace is vnder her lips.</hi> To what end (I pray you) if not to edifie and teach, her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren eſpecially, as <hi>Eunice taught Timothie,</hi> 1. Tim. 1. 5. And the wiſeſt childe that euer was, onely Chriſt excepted, was taught by a woman, Prou. 31. 1. <hi>What my ſonne, &amp;c.</hi> Our children are models of our ſelues; and we deſire to leaue them good portions: now what better portion than the Lord? Kings reioyce in it, <hi>The Lord is my portion,</hi> ſaith <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 119. Let vs therfore labour with them ſo ſoone as euer God hath giuen them for ſonnes vnto vs, to make them his ſonnes: and ſo ſoone as they are come into the world, to take them again out of the world by inſtruction. And what time can bee fitter therefore than the time appointed, which is the Sabbath?</p>
                  <p>Neither are we to thinke our ſelues free, if we performe this duty to our ſonnes only or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: but it muſt be done vnto our whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie; that <hi>ſaluation may not alone come vnto vs, but vnto our whole houſhold,</hi> Luk. 19. 9: which made <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſua</hi> to vndertake for his houſhold, <hi>I and my houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will ſerue the Lord,</hi> Ioſ. 24. And <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius feared God with his houſhold,</hi> Act. 10. 2.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:20637:83"/> vnto the faith by his induſtrie, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome inſtruction. And laſtly, this is the cauſe ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by the holy Ghoſt why God would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint <hi>Abraham</hi> with the deſtruction of Sodom, <hi>for that hee knew he would teach his houſhold to walke, &amp;c.</hi> Now, are not theſe things written for our inſtruction, that wee ſhould doe the like? Why then doe we it not? Indeede there be many that are carefull to prouide meate and drinke for their houſhold; but what great thing is that which they doe? <hi>Doe not the Publicanes the ſame? Doe not the Infidels the ſame?</hi> Nay, doeſt thou not the ſame things for thine oxe, and thine aſſe? I ſpeake it to the ſhame of many, they better prouide for their dogs than their ſeruants. And if this be all, then as one ſaid of <hi>Herod,</hi> when he ſpared not his ſon that he might be ſure to kill Chriſt, he had <hi>rather be his ſwine than his ſonne,</hi> becauſe his ſwine he did not kill, but his ſonne he did: ſo if that be all they prouide for them; better bee their dogges than their drudges or ſeruants; becauſe their dogges bee better prouided for than they.</p>
                  <p>But I now ſpeake vnto you children, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants, and people: Muſt the Miniſter, Maſter, and Parents teach, and you not regard or learne that which is taught you?

And laſtly, becauſe hee knoweth our vntoward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe vnto theſe things, that we come vnto them as a Beare drawne and lead as it were by the noſe vnto the ſtake; he therefore addeth that we muſt be alwaies readie to doe this, &amp;c. which notablie meeteth with the backwardnes of this genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that hardly can bee drawne to learne that which in truth they cannot be without.

                     <hi>Nehemiahs</hi> time, vpon a Sabbath after they had heard the word they did eate, and <hi>ſent part vnto them for whom none was prouided,</hi> Nehe. 8. 10. But now vpon the Sabbath, what is our manner ſo ſoone as we haue dined? No regard is had, but preſently we call for cards or tables, or elſe away we haſte to bowles, or to dauncing, or ſome ſuch like exerciſes: but vnto the poore, <hi>whoſe bowels ſound like ſhaulmes for want of foode, and whoſe faces gather blacknes through famine,</hi> we haue no bowels of compaſſion, notwithſtanding the pitifull child halfe ſtarued and hanging vpon the mothers breaſt crieth out ready to giue vp the ghoſt, <hi>where is bread, and where is drinke?</hi> and that the hearts of the parents fall in ſunder like drops of water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they haue not to giue vnto them. Be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with this my brethren, you that are fed with the fatteſt of the ſtall, and more than the flower of wheate; ſpare ſomething of your exceſſe to relieue their penurie. Behold, <hi>ſhall the mother eate her fruite, and childe of a ſpanne long? ſhall they periſh and die at your doores, and in their houſes?</hi> (for ſome had rather ſtarue at home, than goe abroad to begge) ſhall they periſh (I ſay) without compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? Will you ſpare no diſhes from your tables, nor morſels from your mouthes, to relieue them? no not though Chriſt commaund it, and recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth what is done vnto them as <hi>done vnto himſelf,</hi> Matth. 25. Shall he ſend them vnto you hungrie, pitifull, naked, and miſerable; and will you doe nothing vnto them for his ſake, that did ſo much for yours? If he would, he could haue made you
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:20637:84"/> poore, and them rich, or prouided riches enough for all, or made no more than hee had riches for; or he could haue made that the <hi>Rauens ſhould feed them, as they did Elias;</hi> or that they ſhould haue needed no foode, <hi>as Moſes in the mount.</hi> But hee would haue it thus, to trie what you would doe for him: and therefore to this end he ſaith, <hi>Ye ſhal alwaies haue the poore with you;</hi> why then giue them of your bread to eate, and of your wooll to clothe them. At leaſt if you will not do it for the poores ſake, yet do it for Chriſts ſake. Loe he will accept it as done vnto himſelfe: for, Matth. 25. 4. when the righteous ſhall denie that they had either clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed him, or fed him, &amp;c. what is his anſwere? <hi>In as much as you haue done it vnto one of the leaſt of theſe my brethren, ye haue done it vnto me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, will ſome man ſay, I am a poore man, and I haue nothing for my ſelfe; and therefore no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to giue. Neither had the Apoſtle; <hi>Siluer and gold haue I none,</hi> ſaith <hi>Peter,</hi> Act. 3. 6. yet ſuch as he had he gaue: ſo, haſt thou no ſiluer nor gold; yet thou haſt inſtruction, admonition, conſolation, and ſuch like; giue theſe then, for they be almes and duties of mercie, and are moſt agreeing to the nature of a Sabbath. The other doe good to the bodie, but theſe doe good both to the bodie and ſoule; and this thou oughteſt to doe.

<pb n="152" facs="tcp:20637:85"/> 2. 22. And if it be a dutie to <hi>make peace betwixt man and man</hi> vpon the Sabbath; then much more betwixt God and man. And therefore helpe thy brother with this almes, and relieue his wants: but this if thou haſt not to giue, then thou art poore and needeſt it thy ſelfe, and therefore muſt ſeeke it of others.

That we are bound to meditate vpon the Sabbath, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the practiſe of one of the beſt Sabba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſts that euer was, the Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed it to be his exerciſe continually, Pſal. 119: and if continually, then on the Sabbath much more.

I truſt then that there is no man but will ſay that then he was commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to doe it vpon the Sabbath; and that we haue neede to doe it, it appeareth by the weakneſſe of our memories, which may well be compared vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to aſhes, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, that eaſily loſe any impreſſion that is made in them; and if wee neuer rehearſe that which we haue heard, but ſuffer all to runne
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:20637:85"/> out like leaking tubs, as faſt as it comes in, and that the Preachers words make only a thorowfare in our heads, comming in at the one eare and going out at the other: when ſhall we profit by it? No, no, it is the <hi>hiding</hi> and not the <hi>hearing</hi> of the word that makes vs wiſe. Otherwiſe, as it was ſaid of the widowes, 1. Timoth. 5. that they were <hi>alwaies learning, but neuer comen vnto the knowledge of the truth:</hi> ſo may it be ſaid of many hearers, that they are alwaies hearing, and neuer profiting, becauſe we meditate not on it. Well, the ſtomack that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiueth meate, and preſently putteth it vp againe, we ſay is ſicke. As it fareth with the bodie, ſo is it with the ſoule: if it draw no nouriſhment out of the ſpirituall foode of the word, it is a ſick ſoule.</p>
                  <p>Yea but, will ſome man ſay, my memorie is <note place="margin">An obiection remoued.</note> ſhort, and I cannot remember what the Preacher ſaid. I thinke ſo, vnleſſe you meditate vpon it. But ſir, as ſhort as your memorie is, if a man anger you, you will hardly forget it. But tell me (I pray you) this one thing, as ſhort as your memorie is: did you euer forget where you laid your trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? No, no, <hi>the aſſe himſelfe doth not forget his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters cribbe,</hi> Eſai. 1. 2. and theſe things which wee take care of wee can eaſily remember, bee they done neuer ſo long ſince. And therefore blame not thy memorie but thy will; thou giueſt not thy heart vnto theſe things, as <hi>Dauid that hid the word in his heart,</hi> Pſal. 119. 11. and as <hi>Mary that kept and pondred the ſayings which ſhe had heard of Chriſt in her heart,</hi> Luk. 2. 19. They kept it as it were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der locke and key. But diddeſt thou indeede de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:20637:86"/> to remember theſe things, thou wouldeſt vſe all meanes to conforme thy memorie, and to helpe it. Amongſt the which there is not a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than this, oftentimes to meditate on it. For, as <hi>Salomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the iron bee blunt, put to the more ſtrength,</hi> Eccleſ. 10. 10. (he ſpeaketh as if hee ſaw a man cutting of a ſticke with a bad hatchet, that he can hardly make to cut, he muſt ſtrike the oftner or the ſtronger to cut off the logge) ſo muſt wee doe when wee feele the bluntnes of our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, wee muſt recompence it by the diligence of meditation, often recalling and repeating the ſame thing, by which at the laſt they will become vnto vs as the principles of Grammar vnto the ſchoolemaſter, we ſhal haue them by heart. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes alſo to helpe thy memorie, will be to bring thy heart to the practiſe of that which thou hadſt floting in thy head; and by that meanes thou ſhalt bee ſure to make it thine owne. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to take delight in the things wee heare, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 119. 16. <hi>I will delight in thy ſtatutes, and I will not forget thy word.</hi> Wee forget not the things we delight in. Laſt of al, if thou haſt found thy memorie ſo ſlipperie that it wil hold nothing long, then ſet it down in a note-booke, there lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it vp as in a ſtore-houſe. For if we be carefull in our worldly matters, that we will not truſt our memories with our accounts, but will be ſure to note them downe to a farthing, yea and will keep ſeruants to that purpoſe: what a ſhame is it that we ſhould be ſo negligent in better things.</p>
                  <p>Though neither when we haue done all this,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:20637:86"/> is our meditation done, but wee muſt meditate <note place="margin">We muſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate vpon the workes of God.</note> vpon his workes aſwell as vpon his word. The Pſal. 92, which is intituled, A Pſalme of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, is nothing elſe but a meditation of the workes of God. And this it ſeemeth that God would teach vs by his own example; who when he had finiſhed his workes in ſixe daies, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth he reſted to conſider the goodnes of them, Gen. 2. Now this we may doe, if wee follow the example of Chriſt, who drew euery thing of which he talked vnto a ſpirituall inſtruction: Ioh. 4. 10, when hee talkes with the woman of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria that was drawing of water, he falles into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the water of life. When the Diſciples talke of meate, hee begins to talke with them of another meate, verſ. 4. When hee ſate at dinner, Luk. 14. 15, he turned his ſpeech vnto a ſpirituall banquet. So maiſt thou in the beholding of any of Gods creatures, conſider ſome one thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therein. As when thou lookeſt vpon the graſſe, conſider thy frailtie that <hi>all fleſh is graſſe.</hi> When vpon the duſt, thy baſeneſſe; that <hi>thou art but as duſt, and duſt wil returne to the earth,</hi> Eccl. 12. 7. When vpon the darkneſſe; the time of thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. <hi>Ye were once darkneſſe,</hi> Eph. 5. 8. When vpon the light; the time of the Goſpell, and therefore ibid. <hi>walke in the light.</hi> It is not ſo much as the Ant, but thou maiſt learne ſomething from hir, namely diligence: therefore God ſendeth the ſluggard to ſchoole to the Ant, Pro. 6. 6. <hi>Goe to the Piſmire O ſluggard, &amp;c.</hi> And here I wonder how theſe earth-wormes, whoſe mouldie ſoules are
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:20637:87"/> buried vnder their loaues, and whoſe hearts are pinned and glewed vnto the things of this life, though they nothing but pore vpon the things of this life, yet neuer make any ſpirituall vſe of them, no not vpon the Sabbath; doth not the Lord ſee it, and will not his ſoule be auenged for theſe things? But I had forgotten my ſelf, I ſpeake vnto the bellie that hath no eares. I will therefore ouer-paſſe them.</p>

But were there not any ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to inforce this, yet very reaſon would proue this meete. For two eyes ſee more than one, and many torches put together burne lighter, many hands make light worke, and many aduentures a full fraught: euen ſo alſo commeth it to paſſe, that either conferring with other, eithers portion
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:20637:87"/> is made others; and ſo one portion is made a double, by making a double portion one. For as firebrands put together either giueth heate to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and they burne the better, that the greene wood alſo may take fire; whereas if they be ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred they preſently go out as quenched: euen ſo it fareth with chriſtians in this buſineſſe. Though neither yet doe I ſpeake this to this purpoſe that men ſhould runne into priuate corners to make conuenticles, as the Browniſts; but with their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies and houſhold to conferre and reaſon; or with the Miniſter that is able to direct them in the truth; or with their neighbours that are better able to inſtruct them, who thereby alſo them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are bettered: for knowledge in a man is like the widowes oyle, a man may powre out, and yet the veſſell will bee neuer the emptier.

                  <p>And firſt of all, that ſloth is an occaſion of the <note place="margin">Sloth a let that we keepe the Sabbath no better.</note> breach of the Sabbath, appeareth in that men cannot bee plucked out of their beds vpon the Sabbath, but they <hi>turne themſelues vpon their beds, as the doore vpon the hinges,</hi> Prou. 26. 14. and ſay, as it is Prou. 6. 10. <hi>Yet a little more ſleepe, a little ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> as though God had giuen vs one ſleeping day in ſeuen. And ſo indeede we account of that day as an idle day, and that then wee may ſleepe, becauſe wee haue nothing to doe therein. But Chriſt was of another minde on the Sabbath; for <hi>hee roſe early in the morning before it was light, and went foorth to pray, and then returned againe into the Synagogue to teach,</hi> Mar. 1. 35. 38.

<pb n="160" facs="tcp:20637:89"/> breake the Sabbath, in that they take more paines in tiffing themſelues on that day, than in the whole weeke beſides; their haire forſooth muſt be laid out like rammes hornes (I miſtake, it was the faſhion indeed, but now it is like goates) their ruffes muſt be laid out vpon wiers, like poſte and raile; and their farthingales bearing vp their cloath like a round table.

And of this there is great reaſon. For if a man be not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe reformed, either hee is remiſſe in reforming of others, becauſe they are like himſelfe; or if he be forwards, yet hee ſhall be challenged, becauſe he is in his practiſe vnlike himſelfe, and is like the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:20637:91"/> boate-man that fetcheth his ſtroake one way and looketh another. Therefore God ſpeaketh in the ſecond perſon of the ſingular number; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is, that euery man may know that God ſpeaketh vnto him directly. When Princes make a law they vſe generall termes, as <hi>no man ſhall doe ſuch a thing,</hi> or <hi>euery man ſhall doe ſuch a thing;</hi> but theſe lawes we vſe to ſhift off, as if they concerned vs not. For ſay we, <hi>that which is ſpoken to all, is ſpoken to none.</hi> This God wiſely preuenteth and ſpeaketh to thee directly, <hi>thou ſhalt do no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worke.</hi> The reaſon why God ſpeaketh in this manner is, becauſe ſinne hath gotten her a whores forehead, Ier. 3. 3. it will not bluſh nor bee aſhamed, vnleſſe it bee pointed at, and vnleſſe a man ſpeake vnto it, as the voyce vnto <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar; To thee be it ſpoken.</hi> In deede a good man when he readeth any thing in the Scripture ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in ſo generall termes, doth ſometimes applie it vnto himſelfe, as <hi>Dauid,</hi> Pſal. 40. 7. <hi>In the volume of thy booke</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is written of me that I ſhould doe thy will:</hi> which though it be no where in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular written of <hi>Dauid,</hi> yet hee being a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it in particular vnto himſelfe, as if it had bin ſpoken vnto him. And there be (I confeſſe) ſome like <hi>Dauid,</hi> but this ſect hath not many diſciples. For the moſt are of minde that it concerneth any man rather than themſelues; of which mind <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> alſo was when <hi>Nathan</hi> came vnto him with a parable: which ſtifnes of ours God obſeruing ſpeaketh in particular to euery man, <hi>Thou ſhalt not doe any manner of worke.</hi> So that this euery man
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:20637:92"/> when he readeth it, muſt needes confeſſe as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid,</hi> it is written of me; and ſo muſt the King ſay, this is written of me, that I ſhould keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath; ſo muſt the maſter ſay, this is written of me that I ſhould keepe the Sabbath: ſo the Miniſter, ſo the husbandman, and ſo of the reſt; for this is ſpoken vnto euery man of what place or calling ſo euer he be, of what ſexe or age ſo euer he be. And vnto that purpoſe in the word we ſhall find precepts of euery ſort to inforce ſo much. Iſai. 56. ver. 5. <hi>the Eunuch muſt keepe the Sabbath.</hi> Neh. 13. 15. <hi>the victualler muſt keepe the Sabbath.</hi> Exod. 31. 3, 4. <hi>the artificer muſt keepe the Sabbath.</hi> Nehe. 10. 31. <hi>the buyer and ſeller muſt keepe the Sabbath.</hi> Ierem. 17. <hi>the carriers and porters muſt keepe the Sabbath.</hi> Exo. 34. <hi>the husbandman muſt keepe the Sabbath.</hi> Exo. 44. 24. <hi>the Prieſt muſt keepe the Sabbath.</hi> And what ſhall I more ſay? if any might except, then the Prince, either by reaſon of his authoritie, or his diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in waightie affaires; but the Prince himſelfe muſt be in the middeſt of them, Ezech. 46. 9, 10. And therefore wee ſee none is exempt from this dutie; but thou, whoſoeuer thou art, muſt keepe the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>Though neither yet art thou alone bound in <note place="margin">Thoſe that are vnder vs muſt keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> thine owne perſon to keepe it; but alſo in thy place to ſee it kept. Art thou a father? then thou muſt ſee that thy ſonne keepe it. Art thou a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter? then thou muſt ſee that thy ſeruant keep it. Art thou a Prince? then thou muſt ſee that thy ſubiect keepe it: for the commaundement run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth thus, <hi>thou</hi> muſt keepe it <hi>and thy ſonne,</hi> thou
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:20637:92"/> 
                     <hi>and thy ſeruint,</hi> thou <hi>and thy cattell,</hi> thou <hi>and thy ſtranger.</hi> But why is not the husband alſo in ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſee his wife keepe the Sabbath? The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, firſt, becauſe ſhe is a part of her husband, and they twaine be but one man, Rom. 5. 19. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſhe is a gouernour in the familie with the man, and therefore ſhe is to ſee that others keepe the Sabbath. Thirdly, all are not mentioned in the commaundement, but it is figuratiue, and a part is put for the whole. For as the maſter is ouer the ſeruant, or father ouer his ſonne; ſo is the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band ouer the wife, ſo is the Captaine ouer the ſouldier, and the maſter ouer the ſcholler: and ſo of the reſt. The reaſons wherefore this is inioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the gouernour are two. Firſt, becauſe the gouernour in his place ſhould goe before thoſe that are vnder him in good example, as <hi>Paul</hi> would haue <hi>Timothy</hi> to doe, 1. Tim. 4. 12. For as one coale maketh another burne, and wood a fire, Prou. 26: ſo doth one mans good example in religion bring forward another, eſpecially if they be men of ſort and place. For, as the Loadſtone draweth the iron, and the Iet the ſtraw; ſo draw they others of all ſorts to follow them. As <hi>when Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah kept the Paſſeouer, all the people would keepe it with him,</hi> 2. King. 23. <hi>When Aſa ſware to ſeeke the Lord, all Iudah ſware with him, &amp; reioyced at the oath,</hi> 2. Chr. 15. 15. God would therefore haue them take on in a good way, leaſt they turning aſide to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they ſhould corrupt others; as <hi>Rehoboam when he forſooke the law of the Lord, lead away all Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael with him,</hi> 2. Chron. 12. 1. And <hi>Ieroboam</hi> bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:20637:93"/> the memorie of his defection vntill this day, and ſhall be knowne by it while the world ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, as a man is knowne by his ſirname; <hi>Ieroboam that made Iſrael to ſinne.</hi> One therefore not vnfitly compares them vnto great oakes, that when they fall, beate downe all the vnder wood with them; ſo doe theſe. And ſurely there is no poyſon nor peſtilence that ſo infecteth the ayre where it is, as theſe great ones do the whole countrey, townes and cities round about them where they are, if they be euill. Thoſe therefore that are aboue o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had need to learne <hi>Dauids</hi> leſſon, to be wiſe. For if they be euill, they ſhall not be euill alone; and if they fall, they ſhall carrie a great number with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to hell, as the great diuel did whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he fel, Iud. verſ. 6. Therfore firſt God would haue thoſe that are ouer others to keepe the Sabbath, that by their example others might bee brought to doe the like.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, hee laieth the care of thoſe that are vnder them vpon their ſhoulders, that they might ſee them to keepe the Sabbath, and if o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe they will not, to compell them. And ſo much the more neede was there that this ſhould be put vpon them, becauſe of their backwardnes to doe it; for they let them runne to all exceſſe of riot, and to doe whatſoeuer ſeemeth them good in their owne eyes: they thinke as <hi>Caine; Am I my brothers keeper?</hi> So they, <hi>Am I my ſeruants kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per? am I my ſonnes keeper? am I my ſtrangers keeper?</hi> Yea thou art, and God will not alone aske thee <hi>where thou art,</hi> as he asked <hi>Adam:</hi> but alſo <hi>where is</hi>
                     <pb n="169" facs="tcp:20637:93"/> 
                     <hi>thy brother,</hi> as he did <hi>Caine; where is thy ſonne? where is thy daughter? where is thy ſeruant?</hi> for he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth at thy hand that they keep the Sabbath alſo: the reaſon is, becauſe in matters of religion <hi>there is no reſpect of perſons with God,</hi> Act. 10. 34. He will haue all within the couenant, euen <hi>from the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of water, and hewer of wood, vnto him that ſitteth vpon the throne,</hi> Deut. 29. 10, 11. And Iere. 17. 10. hee requireth <hi>all that enter in at the gates</hi> ſhould keepe the Sabbath. And therefore as <hi>Moſes</hi> when he went to ſacrifice vnto the Lord in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, would not leaue a hoofe behind him, Exo. 10. 26: ſo here alſo hee requireth not onely thy ſonne, thy daughter, thy ſeruant, and the ſtranger to keepe the Sabbath, but alſo that thine oxe and thine aſſe keepe it; hee will not haue a hoofe to breake it.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>2</label> But that we may the more plainly vnderſtand this, thoſe of whom thou haſt charge in this place giuen thee, are either ſuch as thou muſt ſee to keepe the Sabbath in the ſame manner thou art commaunded to keepe it thy ſelfe; of which ſort are <hi>thy children and ſeruants;</hi> or ſuch as if they reſt not, may bee an occaſion vnto thee, or thoſe that are vnder thee, of breaking the Sabbath, as <hi>thy cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell;</hi> or an offence, as <hi>the ſtranger.</hi> But of theſe in particular: and firſt of the firſt ſort. That the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note place="margin">The father muſt ſee that the ſonne keep the Sabbath.</note> is here charged with his children to ſee that they keepe the Sabbath, appeareth in that he wils thee to remember that <hi>thy ſon</hi> and <hi>daughter</hi> keepe it aſwell as thy ſelfe. And therefore thou canſt no more except againſt that part of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:20637:94"/> that concerneth them, than that which concerneth thy ſelfe. Indeede if he had ſaid, thou ſhalt ſee that thou thy ſelfe keepe the Sabbath, and <hi>that thou warne thy ſonne to doe the ſame;</hi> then when thou hadſt warned thy ſonne thou hadſt diſcharged thy ſelfe, but now hee willeth thee to remember that <hi>thy ſonne keepe the Sabbath</hi> aſwell as thy ſelfe, thou canſt by no meanes auoide this charge. And in very truth of this there is great reaſon, becauſe many though they bee aſhamed themſelues to goe ſo farre as in Iere. 7. 18, <hi>to kindle the fire;</hi> yet they can be contented that <hi>their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhould gather the ſtickes,</hi> and <hi>that their women ſhould kneade the dough to bake cakes to the Queene of heauen;</hi> I meane they can be contented to ſuffer their children to runne into all lewdnes, though themſelues bee aſhamed to bee ſcene doing the ſame things. But God to preuent this, chargeth thein here with their children that they obſerue the Sabbath. And therefore as your ſelues do reſt vpon the Sabbath, ſo muſt your children; as your ſelues doe keepe it holie, ſo muſt your children: when you goe to the ſermon, they muſt go with you; when you repeate, they muſt repeate with you; when you goe to prayer, they muſt to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with you. <hi>See not my face</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ioſeph) if you bring not your brother:</hi> ſo, ſee not Gods face, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe you bring your children: if they be wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, God will aske you as he did <hi>Caine; Where is thy brother?</hi> ſo, <hi>where is thy child? where is thy ſonne? where is thy daughter?</hi> What make they a dancing when they ſhould bee at the ſermon? why are
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:20637:94"/> they at play when I commaunded them to reſt? If God (I ſay) ſhould demaund theſe queſtions of many parents, how mute would they ſtand? Well, aſſure your ſelues there is a time of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, when (poore ſoules) they ſhall ſtand ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering before the greateſt Maieſtie, and quaking not being able to anſwere him theſe queſtions.</p>
                  <p>Yea, but what would I haue you to do? your children (you will ſay) will not be ruled. No wil: then chaſtiſe them, and <hi>let not thy ſoule ſpare for their murmuring,</hi> Prou. 19. 18: for <hi>if thou ſet them at libertie, they will ſhame thee,</hi> Pro. 29. 15. Oh (but you will ſay) you are loath to beate them. Alas, and are you ſo cockering? I perceiue then you would be loath to cut their throtes, if God ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund you, as he once commanded <hi>Abraham.</hi> Yet <hi>Abraham</hi> would haue done it, rather than haue diſobeyed God; and haddeſt thou rather diſobey God, than chaſtiſe thy ſonne? Yea, had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou rather let him ſtand vnder the heauie wrath of God, which burneth vnto the bottome of hell for breaking his Sabbath, than to correct him? then woe worth the time, may thy childe ſay, that euer hee knew the, that letteſt him thus to die for want of correction. And this much ſhortly concerning the duties of parents towards their children, in compelling them to keepe the Sabbath.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>3</label> The next dutie is of Maſters towards their ſeruants, who are ſo farre foorth bound to ſee <note place="margin">The maſter muſt ſee that the ſeruant keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath.</note> their ſeruants keepe the Sabbath as themſelues. For God will haue them his ſeruants aſwell as
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:20637:95"/> theirs, and to doe his buſineſſe vpon the ſeuenth day, aſwell as their maſters vpon the ſixe daies. And this in truth wee ought to doe, if not in this regard that God commaundeth vs, whoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ſhould be of greateſt authoritie with vs; yet at leaſt that we may ſhew our ſelues good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernours, and that we gouerne them as tendring their good ouer whom we are ſet: and wherein can we more tender them, than in bringing them vnto the knowledge of the chiefe good, euen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſauing knowledge of God in Ieſus Chriſt? And if we will not yet gouerne as tendring their good; yet at leaſt let vs doe it as tendring our owne: for be yee well aſſured that he that is not faithfull to God, will neuer be faithfull to thee; and that hee that will not ſerue God truly, will neuer ferue thee truly. Well hee may ſerue thee ſo long as thine eye is vpon him, but when thy backe is turned his ſeruice is ended. But the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant that feareth the Lord will be as faithfull vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee when thou lookeſt off, as when thou loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt on; for hee knowes well that a greater than thy ſelfe looketh vpon him; to whom hee muſt anſwere for his ſeruice done to thee. Let this therefore at leaſt teach thee thy dutie to thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants.</p>
                  <p>Yea but, will ſome Maſter ſay, my ſeruants wil not thus be held in by you. No will? who holds them in then to their worke in the weeke daies? If any ſhall then ſtart aſide from your buſineſſe, you will eaſily finde meanes to inforce him; and can you finde no meanes to inforce him to Gods
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:20637:95"/> buſineſſe? Yea but they will not vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath bee held in, but they will then haue their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie. Then let them haue it altogether, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge them. For, wilt thou haue him that will not ſerue God to ſerue thee? thou oughteſt at leaſt to be as carefull for Gods ſeruice as for thine owne. Now thou wilt not keepe a ſeruant that will not faithfully doe thy buſineſſe; how much leſſe then ſhouldeſt thou keepe one that will not ſerue the Lord? <hi>Dauid</hi> would neuer haue done it: for, ſaith he, <hi>a wicked perſon ſhall not dwell in my houſe,</hi> Pſal. 101. Yea, but how ſhall my worke bee done then? Get thee ſuch ſeruants as doe feare the Lord; that was it that <hi>Dauid</hi> purpoſed firſt with himſelfe; <hi>Mine eyes</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall be vnto the faithfull of the land:</hi> And, <hi>He that walketh in a perfect heart he ſhall ſerue me,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>ibid.</hi> And they indeed bee the beſt ſeruants: for they ſerue <hi>not with eye ſeruice, but as the ſeruants of Chriſt, as ſeruing the Lord</hi> in thy buſineſſe, and not thee, Epheſ. 6. 6. Yea, but wee cannot get ſuch. It may be ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you do not walke, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did, in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of your houſe with a perfect heart, verſ. 2. Therefore they will not dwell with you: which if you did, you ſhould not neede to ſeeke: for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants would ſeeke you faſt enough. Yea, if you did ſo walke, by Gods bleſſing, though you did not finde them ſuch, yet you would make them ſuch: but this is the miſerie of it; our ſeruants muſt bee ſent abroad euery Sabbath in errands and trifling buſineſſes, riding, and running, and poſting as if it were for life, as if it were on other
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:20637:96"/> daies in the weeke, as if no commandement were from God to the contrarie. So our owne turnes be ſerued, wee care not how God be ſerued, wee ſhew thereby that wee loue our ſelues more than God. And our ſeruants ſeeing vs not to make conſcience of Gods buſineſſe, they grow to make as little conſcience of ours: eſpecially they being by this meanes depriued of the benefit of the word, whereby they ſhould bee taught better to diſcharge their duties towards their maſters. And thus much for that that the maſter ought to ſee that his ſeruant keepe the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>And as this inſtructeth the maſter in his dutie to his ſeruant; ſo alſo it containeth in it matter of comfort for the ſeruant. For they may hence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the kindnes and loue of God towards him, that notwithſtanding their ſeruitude, yet hee is mindfull of them; they think (poore wretches) that becauſe God hath laid this ſtate of ſeruitude vpon them, therefore hee regardeth them not: no, no, it is not ſo, but he thinkes vpon them, and remembers them euery Sabbath, vouchſafing as it were to looke downe from heauen vpon them in giuing them a reſt, promiſing them as it were in that <hi>reſt,</hi> that one day they ſhall thoroughly <hi>reſt</hi> from their labours, and <hi>reſt</hi> with him in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, where they ſhal be no more in ſeruitude, but ſhall be the Lords free men. Therefore you ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants thinke of this, and learne to ſerue him on his Sabbath, that hath not alone in his fleſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued you; but will aſſuredly in that fleſh ſaue you, and giue you a perpetuall <hi>reſt</hi> if you ſerue him.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:20637:96"/> And behold this he requires at your hands, then doe it, for you cannot ſerue a better maſter. Lay aſide then your fooliſh vanities, your idle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, and impertinent ſports: be no more the ſeruants of ſinne; but as in the whole courſe of your liues, ſo on this day eſpecially bee yee the Lords ſeruants: loe hee offers it. Now who is it that would not ſerue his Prince, if he might? but their ſeruice is nothing to this; for euen Princes themſelues ſue to bee Gods ſeruants; as <hi>Dauid,</hi> though it were but in a meane place, as to bee a doore-keeper, yet he would thinke himſelfe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie: let this therefore be your reſolution to ſerue the Lord. You will ſay (peraduenture) you would, but you cannot, your maſters lay ſuch burthens vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you. And ſurely this I know, many maſters lay greater burthens vpon their ſeruants on the Sabbath, than in any daies of the weeke beſides; they deale therein like <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when <hi>the people deſired to go to ſerue the Lord, then he laid more worke vpon them,</hi> Exod. 5. 9: ſo when they ſhould goe to heare the word of the Lord, then they lay more buſineſſe vpon them. In this caſe what ſhal the poore ſeruant doe? ſhall hee doe Gods buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe or his maſters? Surely <hi>whether it be better to obey God or man, maſters iudge you?</hi> Act. 4. verſ. 19. Though neither herein doe I intend to exempt the ſeruant from being ſubiect to his maſter, in ſuch workes as vpon the Sabbath be lawfull to be done: but if he ſhall ordinarily vpon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mall, or no occaſions be depriued of the publique mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the word, let him in ſuch a caſe rather
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:20637:97"/> venture his maſters diſpleaſure than Gods. And ſurely in my iudgement if he be beaten for it, hee <hi>ſuffereth for well doing,</hi> and therefore <hi>let him take it patiently, for it is acceptable vnto God,</hi> 1. Pet. 2. 20. yea and let him in this put it vp, <hi>not anſwering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine.</hi> For that is required at the ſeruants hands, Tit. 2. 9: or if he anſwere, let it be thus in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of meeknes; for <hi>a ſoft anſwer turneth back wrath,</hi> Prou. 15. 1. Maſter, I pray you haue patience this one day with me; I haue ſerued you faithfully theſe ſixe daies; and I would alſo doe your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe this day, but that my great Lord and Maſter commands me this day to ſerue him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as you would not blame mee if when my Prince commands me, I ſhould leaue your buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes vndone, to ſerue him; how much leſſe ſhould you blame me if I let alone your buſineſſe for a while, when God commaunds me to ſerue him? Thus if ſeruants would anſwere their maſters, I doubt not but that they would ſtay their wrath, and call backe their ſentence of diſpleaſure gone out againſt them. But if they will not heare this ſo reaſonable a requeſt, his ſeruant can iudge no other waies of his maſter than <hi>Nabals</hi> ſeruant did of his maſter; <hi>Surely ſome euill will ſurely come vnto my maſter, and vpon all his familie, for he is ſo wicked that a man cannot ſpeak vnto him,</hi> 1. Sam. 25. 17. And ſo may ſuch maſters thinke of themſelues, if they will not heare their ſeruants intreating them for that which they ſhould inforce them vnto, if of themſelues they would not. And thus much of that the ſeruant ſhould doe.</p>

And firſt of the cattel that they muſt reſt: for the Lord commaundeth here that thine oxe muſt reſt. What, hath God care of oxen? 1. Cor. 9. Yes, he hath. And mercie is to bee ſhewed vnto them; which the <hi>righteous man</hi> will doe, for <hi>he is mercifull vnto his beaſt,</hi> Pro. 12. 19. But that is not here commaunded, but elſewhere in the ſixth precept; Thou ſhalt not kill: where all crueltie is forbidden euen vnto the creature. But the reaſon why here he commaunds reſt vnto the beaſt, is, not for the beaſts ſake, but for the mans ſake; leaſt he ſhould be imployed in ſetting the beaſt to work, and ſo ſhould breake the Sabbath.
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:20637:98"/> So that God dealeth with vs like as a louing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dealeth with his children, who forbids him not onely to hurt himſelfe, but forbids him alſo kniues and edge tooles, wherby he might chance to hurt himſelfe. So hee dealeth in euery com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement. And in the ſixth and ſeuenth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement by name he forbids the meanes of euill: as when hee ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill,</hi> he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biddeth <hi>anger, the whetstone of crueltie:</hi> when hee ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not commit adulterie;</hi> hee forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth <hi>wanton lookes the ſtall of luſt,</hi> Matth. 5. And ſo here <hi>the oxe is forbidden to labour;</hi> to which there is no law; neither is it ſinne to the oxe to worke on the Sabbath; but it is ſinne for man to ſet him to worke; and in that reſpect labour is forbidden the oxe. Like as Exod. 21. 29. <hi>If the oxe puſh and kill through mans negligence,</hi> the owner ſhall anſwere for it: So here, if the beaſt breake the Sabbath through thy default, thou ſhalt anſwere for it: for God requires it at thy hands that he reſt vpon the Sabbath. To conclude this point then, if any ſhal come vnto thee vpon the Sabbath, to borrow thy beaſt to ride to a Wake, or Faire, or ſuch like, wherein the breach of the Sabbath is apparently ſeene; thy anſwere muſt be vnto them, that thou art commaunded to ſee that thine oxe and thine aſſe keepe the Sabbath, and that therefore thou maiſt not lend them about ſuch buſineſſe.</p>

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:20637:98"/> thee. But here it will be demaunded, what is meant by this ſpeech <hi>within thy gates?</hi> By it is meant <hi>thoſe that are within thy power,</hi> as Mat. 16. the gates of hell ſhal not preuaile againſt the church; that is, the power of hell: ſo then, ſo farre as thy power and authoritie extendeth, ſo farre extend the limits of thy gates. As for example, the <hi>whole familie is Abrahams gates;</hi> the <hi>whole citie is Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miahs gates;</hi> and <hi>the whole countrie is Iehoſaphats gates.</hi> And as the Maſter in the familie, and the Magiſtrate in the citie; ſo is the King in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, to ſee the Sabbath kept. And in very truth this ſpeech concerneth Princes and Magiſtrates eſpecially: for in this ſpeaking <hi>within thy gates;</hi> and not, <hi>within thy authoritie or power,</hi> he alludeth vnto their manner of ſitting in iudgement, which was in the gates, and doth thereby as it were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly admoniſh them that ſit in the gates, aboue others, that they ſee that the Sabbath bee kept. And that which we hence note, is, that the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate muſt not alone ſee that the home-borne and free Deniſon, but alſo that the ſtranger keepe the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>But of ſtrangers there were two ſorts: ſome conuerted to the truth, and are called <hi>Proſelytes,</hi> Act. 2. 10: others, that were oppoſite vnto the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in religion, but yet did traffique with them, as, Nehe. 13. thoſe <hi>of Tyre that brought wares to ſell.</hi> Now this commaundement concerned them both, conuert or other. Was he <hi>a ſtranger?</hi> was he <hi>within their gates?</hi> they were to ſee that they kept the Sabbath; or elſe to ſhut them out, as
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:20637:99"/> 
                     <hi>Nehemiah</hi> ſhut out <hi>thoſe of Tyre,</hi> Neh. 13. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that both theſe ſorts of ſtrangers were to bee compelled to keepe the Sabbath, yet after a different manner. For the <hi>Proſelyte</hi> was bound to keep the Sabbath as farre foorth as any Iew, Numb. 9. 14. <hi>there was but one law vnto them both:</hi> but the other ſort of ſtrangers, though they were bound, I confeſſe, by nature vnto the morall law (which is nothing elſe but the law of nature refined as it were by God) and <hi>they had the effect thereof written in their hearts,</hi> Rom. 2. 15: yet the Magiſtrate was not to compell them vnto the outward ceremonie thereof, for that was left free <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 9. 14.</note> vnto them, but they were onely to reſtraine them from practiſing any thing to the contrarie; or if they would not be reſtrained, to puniſh them for the ſame accordingly. And for both theſe points we haue the word plaine and euident. For, that they were reſtrained in the outward ceremonie, appeareth Exod. 12. 19. where the <hi>ſtrangers</hi> were inioyned <hi>to haue no leuen in their houſes;</hi> and here they are commanded to ſee the <hi>ſtranger</hi> keepe the <hi>reſt.</hi> Now if this inhibition would not bee ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to keepe them from the breach of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement; then they were to be puniſhed for their offence, according vnto the ciuill law of the Iewes; as appeareth Leuit. 23. 16. <hi>The ſtranger that blaſphemed</hi> was <hi>to be ſtoned.</hi> And <hi>the Moabiteſſe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for her adulterie aſwell as the Iſraelite,</hi> Num. 25. verſ. 8.

Which muſt teach the Magiſtrate this profitable leſſon; not to ſuffer or permit any thing to be practiſed or done, that is contrarie vnto religion or holineſſe, no not by ſtrangers. And if they may not ſuffer ſtrangers; then much leſſe their owne people. But of this more anon.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>3</label> In the meane time let vs ſee the reaſons why <hi>ſtrangers</hi> were reſtrained. Which was, as I take it, for two cauſes eſpecially: firſt, in reſpect of the Iewes: ſecondly, of themſelues. In reſpect of the Iewes, leſt the libertie of the ſtranger might haue been an occaſion of ſtumbling vnto the Iewes, and ſo their manners corrupted. For it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of men, when they ſee others doe euill, they preſently pleade vnto it, <hi>Why may not I doe ſo aſwell as ſuch a one?</hi> But in good things, they haue not this plea: for grace hath not ſuch force in them to draw them from euill, as corruption hath to draw them to euill. And hence it is that they are ſo ſoone drawne into the imitation of euill in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, but eſpecially in <hi>ſtrangers.</hi> Examples whereof wee haue in the Iſraelites: ſo ſoone as euer they ſaw the new faſhions and attires of the <hi>Galdeans,</hi> that were <hi>ſtrangers</hi> vnto them, they were in loue with them preſently, Ezech. 23. 15, 16. As we here in England are in loue with the faſhions of other countries, and wee can no ſooner ſee a new cut, but wee muſt haue a new garment of the cut, or our garment cut anew, that wee may be in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion; which is hard to be and not to be in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe alſo. Which proneneſſe vnto euill God ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:20637:100"/> in vs, forbiddeth the <hi>ſtranger</hi> to worke vpon the Sabbath, leaſt his children ſhould take occaſion therby to grow into imitation of them, and ſo ſhould breake his Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>And hence wee are taught a profitable leſſon, <note place="margin">We muſt hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of euill.</note> by the example of God himſelf: namely, ſo much as in vs lieth, to hinder and let ſuch euill men (be they ſtrangers or otherwiſe) as doe by their euill manners corrupt others. And therefore <hi>Aſa</hi> was commended that <hi>tooke away the Sodomites out of the land,</hi> 1. King. 15. 12, leaſt by their euill, they might draw others to euill. For this is the nature of <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> they cannot be euill alone, and <hi>their ſleepe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parteth, except they cauſe ſome to fall,</hi> Pro. 4. 16. ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they draw on others; as the <hi>harlot</hi> the yong man in the Prouerbs; <hi>Come, let vs take our fill of loue,</hi> Pro. 7. 18. And the eues call their mates; <hi>Come with vs,</hi> Pro. 1. One ſinner (ſaith <hi>Salomon)</hi> deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth much good, Eccleſ. 9. 8; then what do many, thinke you, eſpecially if they be ſuffered? We ſee in a citie, if one houſe be on fire, if it be not quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, it will fire the whole; and one man infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the plague, is enough to infect a whole towne; <hi>one drop of Colloquintida marreth a whole tunne of oyle;</hi> and <hi>a little leuen ſowreth a whole lumpe of dough,</hi> 1. Cor. 5. All this we know as well as we know the ioynts of our fingers. And we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die enough to quench this fire, leaſt it burne our houſes: and to ſhut vp thoſe that bee infected. But this fire of ſinne is not quenched; neither are men pulled out of it, Iud. 23. Nay rather men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come cole-carriers, like the Adulemite to Iudah,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:20637:100"/> Gen. 38. 20. and gather ſtickes to kindle this fire; as in Iere. 7. 18. the children gather ſtickes, and the fathers kindle the fire, the women make the dough, to bake cakes to the Queene of heauen. Euery one helpeth forward other to euill; and there is no ſhutting vp in this infection, nor ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out theſe leapers out of the campe that are infected with ſinne. Nay, wee turne not from them; we auoide them not; we <hi>paſſe not by them,</hi> which wee ſhould doe, Pro. 4. 14. as wee doe by thoſe that are infected with the plague: but wee take the moſt wicked by the hand, although wee know their ſinnes aſwell as if they were ſtamped in their forheads. And by this doing we ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then them, leaſt they ſhould returne from their wickedneſſe, Ierem. 23. 14. The brothell and the harlot haue free ſcope to allure and intice moſt flouriſhing and towardly wits; and no man ſaith vnto them, <hi>what doest thou?</hi> Vpon the Sabbath, Lords of miſrule, fidlers, Ieſters and ſuch like are ſuffered to prophane the beſt day of ſeuen, and to leade our youth into all exceſſe of riot; and no man letteth; nay rather wee thruſt them forward vnto it. But if any man ſhall be more forward in reſtraining them, that ſhall be turned vpon him as a note of <hi>a Puritan, he is factious, he is contentious,</hi> and <hi>he loueth no good fellowſhip;</hi> as though a man could not loue good fellowſhip, vnleſſe hee will ſuffer Gods Sabbath to be broken: or as though that were good fellowſhip to breake Gods Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath. But what doe I complaine of theſe things? ſeeing it is the time that the Apoſtle ſpeaketh of
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:20637:101"/> 2. Tim. 3. 3. that men ſhall be <hi>deſpiſers of them that are good, traytors, headie, high minded, and louers of pleaſure more than louers of God.</hi> And ſo they be; for they preferre their ſports before the Lords Sabbath: and therefore though they haue a <hi>ſhew of godlineſſe</hi> (for they will be called Chriſtians) yet they denie the power thereof: for it ſhall not allure them to walke in the obedience thereof. And therefore wee paſſe vnto the ſecond rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
                  <p>Now as the former reaſon was in regard of the good of the Iewes; ſo there was another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in regard of their owne good; and that in reſpect of the principalleſt part in them, their ſoules; of which (though they were ſtrangers) they were to haue a care. For if a man muſt haue a care of his enemies beaſt, Exod. 23. 4; muſt hee not much more haue a care of his ſoule? And how could they better ſhew their care than in this, that they might thereby be lead forward to the hearing of the law? For as wee ſee many worldly men, when they haue nothing to doe will goe heare a ſermon with their neighbours, when yet they will not neglect the leaſt wordly buſineſſe, for the beſt ſermon of them all: ſo doubtleſſe fared it with theſe ſtrangers. And therefore in regard hereof, God vpon the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath commaundeth them a reſt from all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and enioynes the Iewes to looke vnto it that they keepe the Sabbath, that at leaſt they ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing nothing to doe, might goe heare the word for companie. And ſo we ſee many of them did.
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20637:101"/> For, Ioſh. 8. vlt. the law was read vnto the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger that was conuerſant amongſt them.</p>
                  <p>And from this reaſon wee are taught another dutie: namely, to labour to bring others, ſo farre <note place="margin">We muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to bring others to the knowledge of God.</note> foorth as we may, to the knowledge of God. As <hi>Andrew brought Simon Peter to Chriſt,</hi> Ioh. 1. 42. and <hi>Philip brought Nathaniel,</hi> ver. 46. So <hi>Matthew,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Chriſt was to dine with him, had <hi>many publicans and ſinners there,</hi> Matth. 9. And <hi>Cornelius,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was to come vnto him, <hi>called his friends and kinsfolks together,</hi> Act. 10. 24, that they might heare <hi>Peters ſermon.</hi> And herein ſhould Chriſtians bee like vnto thoſe that brought the man ſicke of the palſie, that could not goe; that brought him (I ſay) vpon their ſhoulders vnto Chriſt: ſo ſhould we endeuour vpon our ſhoulders to carrie them, and to lend them as it were our legges, to bring them to Chriſt that haue no legges of their own. It is the manner of men when they come vnto any that is ſicke, if themſelues haue been ſick, and receiued health by the hands of any Phyſition, preſently to will the ſicke to ſend vnto them, by whoſe hands themſelues haue receiued comfort: or if they know any medicine that did them good, they will acquaint them with it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of grew that prouerbe partly, <hi>either a foole or a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;</hi> becauſe euery one almoſt be hee neuer ſo ſimple, yet will be preſcribing ſomething to the ſicke. But in the ſicknes of the ſoule, why doe we not will them to come to <hi>our Phyſition Chriſt?</hi> to whom if they come, it skils not how daungerous the diſeaſe be; for hee will eaſe them, Matth. 11.
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:20637:102" rendition="simple:additions"/> And why doe wee not acquaint them with our medicines, and ſhew them the <hi>tree of life,</hi> which is our phyſicke; the <hi>leaues of which tree will cure all diſeaſes,</hi> Reuel. 22. 2. Surely if we euer haue been rightly touched with our owne ſicknes, wee will be readie to helpe others. And in the meane time let vs know it is a dutie. And ſo much for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

Sect. </seg>4</label> Hauing thus in particular ſhewed the reaſons why the ſtrangers are reſtrained; let vs now ſee laſtly what all theſe words in the generall, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in them to be obſerued. And firſt, in that he ſaith, that <hi>thou, thy ſonne, thy daughter, thy ſeruant, the ſtranger;</hi> euen all, muſt keep the Sabbath; note <note place="margin">Toleration of a falſe religion may not be ſuffered.</note> that diuerſities of religions are not to be ſuffered in one kingdome, citie, or familie. For that were to make it to <hi>ſtand vpon feete partly of iron, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of clay,</hi> and to bring in ſuch a <hi>confuſion of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions,</hi> as there was <hi>of languages in Babel;</hi> which God who is <hi>but one,</hi> cannot endure. For either we muſt worſhip another beſides him; or elſe there be more waies than one to worſhip God aright by. But that a man ſhould worſhip another, that he can in no ſort abide: for that were to diſpoile him of his glorie. For <hi>his worſhip is his glorie,</hi> Pſal. 50. 23. and therefore he will not part with it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of the three things which he hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued vnto himſelfe: firſt, his <hi>vengeance:</hi> ſecondly, his <hi>iudgement:</hi> and thirdly, <hi>his glorie.</hi> Now as for his vengeance hee craueth that; <hi>vengeance</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is mine,</hi> Heb. 10. 30. So alſo is iudgement, <hi>hee hath appointed a day for that,</hi> and <hi>it is not in man to</hi>
                     <pb n="187" facs="tcp:20637:102"/> 
                     <hi>know the time,</hi> Act. 1. 7. But as for his <hi>glorie,</hi> he will in no ſort part with that; for <hi>he will not giue his glorie vnto another,</hi> Iſai. 42. 8. and to aske it were to take from him his kingdome. And what could a man deſire more to bee God? and therefore hee will not part with his worſhip. And to ſay that there be more waies than one to worſhip God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right by, is moſt falſe. For as there is but <hi>one truth,</hi> ſo there is but <hi>one faith,</hi> and <hi>one hope of our calling.</hi> The hope of our calling is heauen; that is but one, the entrance is by the Lord Ieſus Chriſt, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 2. 18. which is <hi>the doore,</hi> Ioh. 10. And there is <hi>but one Lord Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 4. 5. And the meanes by which we enter is by <hi>faith:</hi> for <hi>we haue entrance by him through faith,</hi> Rom. 5. 2. and that alſo is <hi>but one,</hi> Epheſ. 4. 4, 5. Then if there be but <hi>one heauen,</hi> and but <hi>one way</hi> into it, and but <hi>one meanes</hi> to enter by that way; it cannot be that there ſhould bee more waies to ſerue God aright by, than one. And therefore diuerſities of religion cannot bee ſuffered: vnleſſe alſo in his worſhip he will now endure that which in the time of the law hee would not; for then he would not endure them to <hi>plough with an oxe and an aſſe together,</hi> Deut. 22. 10. or <hi>to ſow their fieldes with mingled ſeedes,</hi> or <hi>to weare a garment of diuers ſtuffes:</hi> all which though they were ceremonies, lead them directly by the hand to this that now wee treate of, namely that they ſhould not endure diuerſities of religion. And if hee did then diſlike <hi>haulting betweene two opinions,</hi> will he allow vs now, thinke you, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe Iudaiſme and Chriſtianitie, Goſpell and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:20637:103"/> true religion and Poperie? No, no, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be. For betwixt the <hi>Arke and Dagon, God and Mammon, Sion and Babylon</hi> there is no agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but they are like poyſons in the ſtomack, the one ſtill ſicke of the other: and how then ſhould that bodie bee healthfull that containes them both. Reuel. 2. Pergamus is blamed <hi>for maintaining the doctrine of Balaam,</hi> ver. 14. Thyaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra <hi>for ſuffering Iezabel to teach,</hi> ver. 20; and will not the ſame expoſitor euen the holie Ghoſt carrie the ſame with as readie a hand againſt ſuch as are <hi>Proteſtants and Papiſts, Vters and Neuters, Omnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, Solifidians</hi> and <hi>Nullifidians?</hi> Or was it <hi>Paul</hi> that would not ſo much as endure any copart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip in the Church of Galatia, not ſo much as to tolerate Iewiſh ceremonies? Gal. 5. 2; and will he, thinke you, endure that theſe <hi>beggerly rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Poperie</hi> (I ſay more) <hi>intollerable blaſphemies</hi> ſhould ſtand vp by the ſcepter of his word? No, no: <hi>his ſheepe will heare his voyce</hi> one degree fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: <hi>and another they will not heare,</hi> Ioh. 10. And therefore if we be Gods ſheepe, we will heare his voyce: but another voyce we will not heare. And therfore as <hi>Elias</hi> ſaid, <hi>Why halt you betweene two opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions? if God be God, follow him;</hi> if <hi>Baal of Rome be God, follow him:</hi> but both you cannot follow, for a man cannot ſerue God and Mammon, but hee muſt forſake the one, and cleaue vnto the other.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore we diſclaime their opinions as pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilent, that would ſow our field with the miſlen of Poperie; and would mingle the pure wine of the word with the water of their inuentions. No,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:20637:103"/> let them perſwade this to their <hi>Catholique</hi> King of Spaine, as they terme him; let him firſt practiſe this, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will not now endure ſo much as a book to be brought into his countrie by our Merchants; if it ſtand any thing againſt their ſuperſtition; let them (I ſay) perſwade him that the Chriſtians may haue toleration of their religion, and then when they haue perſwaded him, let them aske vs that queſtion afterwards. In the meane time, we will beleeue that then the bodie is ſtrongeſt, when <hi>the multitude of beleeuers are of one heart, and of one minde,</hi> Act. 4. and not as the Ieſuites would perſwade vs, that diuiding in religion would be an vniting in policie. Yet leaſt they ſhould think we are not able now to returne them an anſwere; this I ſay that I ſee not but that they may with as good reaſon ſue to haue a toleration to murther, commit adulterie, and ſteale, as to demaund this, for then they ſhould ſinne but againſt man; but this is a ſinne directly againſt God, and againſt the good both of bodie and ſoule; this againſt the firſt table to ſuffer any other religion than the true religion; the other but againſt the ſecond, and not ſo grieuous. Yea but this would be a quieting of all ſtirs. Nay, it would be a beginning of all ſtrife; yea it were the way to rend the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in two. An example whereof we finde in <hi>Salomon,</hi> who ſuffered two religions, a true which himſelfe profeſſed, and a falſe which his concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines held. But what followed? a rending of his kingdome, that as he ſuffered them to be diuided in opinion, ſo afterwards by Gods iuſt iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:20637:104"/> his kingdom was diuided and rent in two. And ſurely this is it that the Ieſuites be ſicke of, that either they might bring the Spaniard to be a lawgiuer in England, for they hold him the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique King, that is by their owne interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vniuerſall; or elſe at the leaſt that they might bring his triplicitie, I meane the Pope, to ſhare a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with the Kings in England; and to ouertop them. And this is the reaſon wherefore they ſo much labour this matter to bring in a toleration. From which we ought to be ſo farre and ſo wide, as that wee muſt compell them vnto the truth; which is the ſecond thing here to be noted.</p>

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:20637:104"/> God, and to goe out into the high waies and to compell them to come in; which yet chiefly is the dutie of the Prince or Magiſtrate, who is <hi>Gods minister to take vengeance vpon them that doe euill,</hi> Rom. 13. 4. And therefore <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when hee ſaw men of Tyrus, which brought wares on the Sabbath, though firſt he <hi>reprooues the rulers of the Iewes,</hi> verſ. 17. for ſuffering ſuch an abuſe; for they ſhould haue looked vnto it, that no ſtranger nor other ſhould breake the Sabbath: yet when hee had ſo done, he <hi>commaundeth the gates to be ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them,</hi> verſ. 19.

Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when he ſees all this will not preuaile, but that they ſtay about the walles all night, then hee ſets downe an order againſt them; that <hi>if they tarried all night about the walles once againe,</hi> they ſhould be puniſhed, for he <hi>would lay hands on them,</hi> verſ. 21. And this I take it muſt euery Magiſtrate do aſwell as <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> for he hath the charge of both the Tables committed vnto him; of the firſt, aſwell as of the ſecond. Which thing was figured in that in the Coronation, the <hi>Teſtimonie,</hi> and the <hi>Crowne</hi> were giuen both together vnto the King, 2. King. 11. 12. that hee might know the Crowne was giuen him for this end and purpoſe, that hee might maintaine Religion. And therefore wee are willed to pray for Kings, that <hi>wee may liue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet life vnder them in all godlineſſe,</hi> as well as <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtie,</hi> 1. Tim. 2. 2. So that Kings muſt ſtudie to do both theſe. They muſt not bee like vnto <hi>Gallio,</hi> which had <hi>no care of religion,</hi> Act. 18. 15. Such are
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:20637:105"/> no better than beaſts, and ſo the Prophet reckons of thoſe foure Monarchies in Dan. 7. that cared not for religion, hee compared them vnto foure beaſts. And <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, that <hi>man that is in honour and vnderſtandeth not, is compared vnto the beaſts that periſh,</hi> Pſalm. 49. vlt. Neither is this alone for Kings, but alſo for our great Lords, that are (as I may ſay) little Kings; theſe muſt bee nurſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers alſo: and that was ſignified, as I take it, when the heads and chiefe of the Tribes were placed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Tabernacle, Numb. 2. As <hi>on the Eaſt ſide, were the rulers of Iudah, Iſacher and Zebulon. On the South, the rulers of Ruben, Simeon, and Gad. On the Weſt, the rulers of Ephraim, Manaſhe, and Beniamin. And on the North, the rulers of Dan, Aſher, and Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thali.</hi> Loe thus did the chiefe of the people ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round and hemme in the Tabernacle. But this is not it that is ſo much ſtriuen about, the queſtion is how farre Princes may meddle in matters of religion to compell: for Papiſts ſay that the Pope hath both ſwords; and that Princes muſt not meddle in matters of religion; no not to puniſh any vntill they be deliuered ouer vnto the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar power. So then they make belike <hi>Princes</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>the Popes butchers,</hi> to cut the poore lambes throte when he will haue it ſo; or rather the <hi>Pope</hi> is indeede <hi>the butcher,</hi> and the Prince but his boy, to hold the ſheepes legges whileſt the butcher cuts his throte. I will not diſpute this queſtion neither; but I come vnto that which I propoſed: that is, how farre Princes may meddle in matters of religion to compell thereunto. Firſt
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:20637:105"/> therefore the Prince muſt eſpecially ſee that his people bee taught the law of God, and that was the reaſon why <hi>Ioſiah cauſed the law to be read vnto all the people,</hi> 2. King. 23. 1. Secondly, in the ſame place (for that almoſt teacheth a King his dutie) when he hath cauſed them to bee taught, he <hi>bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth them by couenant vnto the ſame; yea and himſelf alſo,</hi> verſ. 3. Thirdly, hauing thus done, then hee goes to reformation, and there hee begins with the <hi>Priests.</hi> Firſt, hee makes them <hi>bring out of the Temple all the veſſels that were made for Baal,</hi> verſ. 5. Then <hi>he deſtroyes their Idols, and their houſes,</hi> verſ. 6. When he hath ſo done (for this was not all, for he had a greater toyle with them, than euer King <hi>Henry</hi> had with the Abbeys in England) hee comes to the Kings houſes, and there firſt <hi>hee breakes down the Altars of the Kings of Iudah,</hi> ver. 10. He <hi>breakes downe Manaſſes altar,</hi> verſ. 12. Then the <hi>high places that Salomon had built for Aſteroth and Chemos.</hi> And laſtly, <hi>the Calues of Ieroboam,</hi> verſ. 15. Now hauing taken away all theſe abominations; then fourthly, <hi>he brings the people backe againe vnto the obſeruation of the true worſhip of God, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunds all the people to keepe the Paſſeouer,</hi> verſ. 21. Thus farre went <hi>Ioſiah.</hi> But now, what if they had refuſed this, what then? Surely hee would then haue ranne a further courſe with them, he would no doubt haue inforced them by puniſhment, which is the fifth dutie and the laſt in a Prince, when no courſe will ſerue, then to inforce, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment vpon them, either in their goods, as <hi>Saul; Thoſe that come not foorth after me</hi> (ſaith he)
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:20637:106"/> 
                     <hi>thus ſhall his oxen be killed,</hi> 1.

Chro. 15. 15. And thus farre, I take it, a Prince hath power to proceede againſt an obſtinate contemner of Gods truth.

The firſt is in theſe words, <hi>Sixe daies</hi>

                     <hi>ſhalt thou labour, &amp;c.</hi> and it is an argument <hi>à fortio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri,</hi> perſwading from the greater to the leſſe thus: If I haue giuen thee ſixe daies to worke in them, then thou oughteſt of conſcience to reſt one day: but I haue allowed thee ſixe, and therefore
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:20637:107"/> reſt the ſeuenth. This is the manner of this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but me thinkes it is propoſed by way of anſwer as it were, vnto ſome queſtion that might be obiected vpon the former words: for where as God had in the commandement required to reſt the ſeuenth day, ſome might obiect (as many doe) that it were very hard to reſt a whole day. To which hee anſwereth, that they ought at leaſt to reſt one whole day, being that God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed vpon them ſixe to their owne vſes. So that here I might take an occaſion to anſwere thoſe that thinke it ſufficient on the Sabbath if they come to the publique exerciſe, though they ſpend the reſt in ſports: but this naile I haue dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen before; come we now to the words: <hi>Sixe daies ſhalt thou labour, &amp;c.</hi> Firſt, in that that he giues vs ſixe daies to doe our buſineſſe in, therein hee lets vs ſee that ſixe daies are ſufficient for vs to do our buſineſſe in, and for the diſpatch of all our works; and if that he had ſeene that we ſhould haue nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded more, hee would haue giuen them; but ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſixe were ſufficient, he gaue no more, though in reſpect of himſelfe as hee is Lord of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath (and ſo is he alſo of all the reſt of the daies of the weeke) hee could haue giuen vs more. And therefore as he ſaith, Pſal. 50. 10. <hi>All the beaſts of the forreſt are mine:</hi> ſo may he ſay, <hi>All the daies of the weeke are his;</hi> by which right hee might haue craued of vs euery ſecond or third day. Yet hee deales more liberally with vs, and requireth but the ſeuenth. Then hence to perſwade you to keepe this Sabbath, let me reaſon with you as
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:20637:107"/> 
                     <hi>Naamans</hi> ſeruant did with his maſter; <hi>What</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the Prophet had commaunded thee a greater thing than this, wouldeſt not thou haue done it? how much more then when he ſaith, Waſh and be cleane?</hi> 2. King. 5. 13. So I ſay; if the Lord had commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded thee a greater thing than this, wouldeſt thou; wouldeſt thou (do I ſay) nay oughteſt thou not to haue done it? how much more then when he ſaith, keepe the ſeuenth? And if we refuſe this to keepe one of ſeuen, what would we doe if he ſhould require one of three or foure? So that Gods liberalitie in this caſe doth much aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate the ſinne of man, when reſtraining him but in one, and giuing him plentie of others, yet hee will not be reſtrained from that one. This was it that made <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne out of meaſure ſinfull, that hauing plentie of all the trees of the garden, both for varietie and ſacietie, Geneſ. 2. 9. yet he muſt needes taſte the forbidden fruite. So was this alſo that which made <hi>Dauids</hi> ſinne a notable ſinne, that hauing many wiues of his owne, yet hee could not be content with all theſe, but hee muſt take the wife of poore <hi>Vriah,</hi> 2. Sam. 12. 9. Well, I know not how deepe this argument ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth into the hearts of Sabbath-breakers, their conſciences are ſo ſeared and ſo hardened with the cuſtome of that ſinne, and their hearts ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered as it were with a ſhield of brawn, that they are growne paſt feeling of it: but I am verely perſwaded at the day of account it ſhall ſtick vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them neerer than the marrow cleaueth vnto the bones; and it ſhall bee more ſenſible vnto
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:20637:108"/> them, than the tendereſt bile in the world. When (I ſay) they ſhall heare God out of his law to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this ſort againſt them; I gaue you ſixe daies to doe your worldly buſineſſe in, to labour, to ride, to runne, to buy, to ſell, to ſow, to reape, to ſolace your ſelues, to ſee your friends, to make merrie, &amp;c. and yet cannot you bee contented with them, but that you muſt incroach vpon me to take my holy day alſo, and to ſpend it, I ſay not vpon your labours, but that which is more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tollerable, vpon your luſts and delights. This (I ſay) cannot but ſtrike them thorough, and make their harts to fall in ſunder like water, when they ſhall conſider their great ingratitude towards him, that when he of ſeuen could affoord to giue them ſixe, they of ſeuen cannot affoord to giue; (giue doe I ſay? out vpon it) nay cannot ſuffer him to enioy one. The ſcarre of churliſhnes ſticketh like a ſtarre in the forhead of <hi>Nabal,</hi> and ſhall to the worlds end, 1. Sam. 25. 3. that <hi>Dauid</hi> when in regard of his kindnes ſhewed vnto his ſhepheards in the wilderneſſe, requiring him to giue him a preſent of any thing that came next vnto his hand, the churle refuſed to doe it. Now <hi>Nabal</hi> how ſoeuer churliſh, yet this was his owne, it was in his power, and it was prouided for his ſhearers: yet for all this, is hee iuſtly condemned for a chrule, in that hee ſent not a preſent vnto <hi>Dauid,</hi> that had ſo well deſerued it. With what words then may this ſinne of ours be ſufficiently aggrauated, that whereas God of his bountie of ſeuen hath giuen vs ſixe, if we alſo ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:20637:108"/> from him that one? If a poore man on the way as thou trauelleſt ſhould come vnto thee, and craue of thee for Gods ſake to beſtow vpon him ſomething to relieue him, and thou out of thy liberalitie and compaſſion towards him ſhouldeſt giue him all the money in thy purſe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruing onely a very little for thine owne vſe to bring thee home; if hee (I ſay) ſhould catch thy purſe and that alſo, and run away with it, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt thou not account him very vngratefull? Yet thy vngratitude to God is as great as his and more; for in very truth thou art ſo bound vnto God, as that if thou ſhouldeſt giue halfe of thy daies, yea all of them back againe vnto him, thou couldeſt not ſufficiently recompence him.</p>
                  <p>To conclude therefore this point, let that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon which mooued <hi>Ioſeph</hi> not to conſent to his Miſtris preuaile with thee; <hi>My maſter hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted all into my hand, and hath kept nothing from me, but onely thee, becauſe thou art his wife; how then ſhall I doe this great wickedneſſe and ſinne againſt God?</hi> Geneſ. 39. So ſhouldeſt thou anſwere thy companions, when they ſhall allure thee on the Sabbath to ſinne: <hi>The Lord hath giuen me all the daies in the weeke to doe my workes in, ſauing onely this one he hath reſerued vnto himſelfe; how then can I do this great wickedneſſe, and ſinne againſt the Lord in breaking his Sabbath?</hi> And thus much for the manner of the reaſon, how it inforceth vs to the keeping of the Sabbath.</p>
                  <p>The doctrine that we learne hence is, firſt that the commandements of God ſtand, all of them,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:20637:109"/> and are grounded vpon good reaſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that <hi>all his commandements are</hi> not onely <hi>true,</hi> Pſal. 119. 86, but <hi>righteous</hi> alſo, verſ. 106. Yea they are all <hi>moſt iuſt,</hi> verſ. 128. And there is nothing in the world that ſtandeth with ſuch reaſon as the ſeruice of God; which maketh the Apoſtle to call it our <hi>reaſonable ſeruing of God,</hi> Rom. 12. 2. And therefore Ezec. 18. 25. God blames thoſe that ſay <hi>his waies are vnequall;</hi> and no leſſe worthie of blame are ſuch as thinke that it is vnreaſonable to keepe a whole day holie vnto the Lord. Why then how ſhould their buſineſſe goe forward? why then when ſhould they haue any time for recreation? What is all this but to finde fault with Gods law, as if it were not iuſt, as if it were not equall. But what ſaiſt thou, is it not equall? and is it not meete that thou ſhouldeſt haue thy ſixe daies to doe thy buſineſſe in, which God hath allowed thee? And is it not as meete that God ſhould haue one? Let this therefore ceaſe thy murmuring againſt Gods law, ſeeing it ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth with ſuch good reaſon.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond doctrine that wee note in theſe words, <hi>Sixe daies ſhalt thou labour,</hi> is this, that as it is ſinne for vs ordinarily to worke on the ſeuenth day; ſo alſo is it ſinne for vs through negligence or idlenes, not to diſpatch our worldly buſineſſe in the ſixe daies, ſeeing he hath allowed them vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs for that purpoſe. And therfore on them we ought to labour; and it behoueth vs ſo much the more carefullie to labour in them, ſeeing that God hath enioyned man <hi>to labour in the ſweate of</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:20637:109"/> 
                     <hi>his browes,</hi> Geneſ. 3. Yea ſeeing, as <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, <hi>he is borne to labour as the ſparkles flie vpward,</hi> Iob. 5. 7. And hence it is that God hath left him ſo many precedents of labour before his eyes; the oxe is made to till the land, and tread out the corne; the aſſe is to ſtand vnder the burthen; the heauens are ſtill in their motion as it were ſtill a working; the Angels are miniſtring ſpirits, Pſal. 104. 4; and when man was in the ſtate of perfection God would not haue him idle, Gen. 2. though God had no neede of his worke, nor the garden; for it brought out all things without planting; yet hee would haue man to labour, becauſe man had neede of it; and therefore ſets him his taske to dreſſe and trimme the garden.

                  <p>Then here are thoſe ſlow bellies and idle Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey lubbers condemned, that ſpend whole daies in doing nothing; that are like paralitique and gowtie members, looſe and vntied in the ioynts of obedience; that ſay vnto the head commaund vs not, for we will not moue, neither will we ſtir.

Then to conclude, ſeeing ſuch a legion of ſinnes waite vpon this one ſinne, let vs ſhunne and auoide it; and let vs walke in that vocation wherein God hath called vs; conſidering that as the iron that lieth ſtill, ruſteth; the water that runneth not, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupteth; and the field that is not manured, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth foorth weedes: ſo it fareth with the ſoule of the ſluggard; in ſteede of the good graces of God which ruſt and decay euery day in him, there ariſeth nothing but the affections of an idle braine, as weedes in a land vntilled.

<pb n="203" facs="tcp:20637:110"/> wherein we may profit either Church or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and let vs know that it is not left in our power to labour, or not; but let vs aſſuredly know that God enioynes vs labour: for, <hi>Sixe daies ſhalt thou labour.</hi>

Secondly, whether it bee not lawfull to conſecrate any one or more of the ſixe daies to Gods ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Touching the firſt, it is true which the Apoſtle ſaith; Bodily exerciſe profiteth little, 1. Tim. 4. 8. he ſpeakes of faſting, the beſt of theſe exerciſes: yet ſomething it doth profit, and for that profits ſake we are allowed at ſome time to vſe it, ſeeing that God allowes a time thereunto; as Eccleſ. 3. <hi>There is a time vnto euery purpoſe, a time to laugh, a time to daunce, &amp;c.</hi> Yea, and if wee conſider the weaknes and corruption of our nature, wee ſhall finde that we haue neede of ſuch times; for wee are not of ſuch a temper as to hold out ſtill, if our natures bee not repaired and refreſhed: but it is like vnto a bow, if it ſtand long bent, it will caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; and therefore it is allowed vnto vs ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to vnbend as it were our wits, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh our ſpirits; and as in a great combat, to breathe a while that we may returne with a freſh incounter. And to that end God hath allowed vs exerciſes both for the bodie and minde; for the minde, as <hi>Sampſon</hi> vſed <hi>riddles,</hi> Iud. 14. 12. and <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi>

Sam. 20. and <hi>Eſau</hi> vſed <hi>hunting,</hi> Gen. 27. And this a man may doe, if hee conſider theſe things: Firſt, that the mirth be allowable, or that it be not corrupt or ſcurrilous: for <hi>fooliſh ieſting is condemned,</hi> Eph. 5. 4: or dangerous, as Pro. 20. 18. <hi>The foole faineth himſelfe mad, and caſteth firebrands and arrowes and mortall things, and ſaith, Am not I in ſport?</hi> Secondly, that wee vſe them with modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We muſt doe as <hi>Salomon;</hi> when we giue our ſelues to theſe things, we muſt be ſure to <hi>leade our hearts in wiſedome,</hi> Eccl. 2. 1. And though we <hi>taste</hi> of the <hi>hony combe</hi> with <hi>Ionathan,</hi> yet we muſt not <hi>eate too much,</hi> Prou. 25. 27. And therefore if wee much deſire it, then we muſt remember <hi>Salomons</hi> watch-word; <hi>Put thy knife to thy throte,</hi> Pro. 23. 2. In the vſe of theſe things therefore a man had neede doe as <hi>Vliſſes,</hi> when hee heard the Syrens, firſt to binde himſelfe faſt vnto the maine maſt, that he might not be drawne away by them: for though theſe bee not the diuels cart-ropes, yet they be made dangerous cords of vanitie often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to draw a man to further miſchiefe; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if hee conſider not the end of theſe recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; that wee vſe them in reſpect of a greater good; and to make vs fitter vnto better things; euen as a man vſeth ſauce to ſharpen his ſtomack, becauſe it is weake. But many men in their ſports know neither end nor meaſure; whole nights or daies are not ſufficient, but that they muſt change and alter Gods couenant, and turne the nights into daies, to extend their ſports vnto the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:20637:111"/> limits, yea and to leape from one ſport vnto another, as the flye doth from one ſcab vnto ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. When will theſe men (I thinke) be wearie? will they neuer haue done? meane they to make it the end of their life, <hi>to liue to play?</hi> Woe worth ſuch a life, tenne times worſe than death; becauſe liuing they die, as <hi>the widow that liued in pleaſure was dead whiles ſhe liued,</hi> 1. Tim. 5. 6. And ſhall they not then dying die eternally, as the rich man that went to hell, for all his pleaſures? Luk. 16. 25. But what ſpeake I? I know my words are too weake to perſwade theſe, they are ſo deeply ſet. Well, yet let them remember the voyce that will come at midnight, and happely may ſpeake vnto them in the middeſt of their pleaſures, as the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing appeared vnto <hi>Baltaſher</hi> in the middeſt of his pleaſures. I ſay no more, but think vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. And laſt of all, weigh well the circumſtances of time, place, &amp; perſons, with whom thou vſeſt theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations: for there is not the leaſt of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> but may make thy recreations ſinfull. As for example, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered, it may be lawful for a man to ſhoote or bowle: but is this lawfull to doe it when the preacher is in the pulpit? or is it lawfull to play in the time of prayer? or to vſe it with thoſe whom a man would diſdaine that they ſhould ſit with the dogges of his flocke, they bee ſo vile and prophane? But what power or force circumſtances haue in things indifferent to make them lawfull or vnlawfull, I haue abundantlie ſhewed in the beginning of the chapter of <hi>reſt.</hi>
                     <pb n="206" facs="tcp:20637:112"/> Let this therefore ſuffice for anſwere to the firſt queſtion.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>3</label> The ſecond queſtion is, whether it bee lawfull to conſecrate any one or more of theſe daies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lords ſeruice. The anſwere is, that vpon ſome extraordinarie occaſion the Church and the Magiſtrate may appoint one or more of theſe daies vnto Gods ſeruice. For although a man may not prophane or make common that which is conſecrate, vnleſſe in caſe of neceſſitie, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did the ſhew bread, Matth. 12. yet he may conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate vpon a iuſt occaſion that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as appeareth euery where. Yea euen of theſe ſixe daies wee finde ſome conſecrate vnto the Lord, as two daies in <hi>Hester</hi> called the <hi>feaſt of Purim,</hi> Heſt. 9. And <hi>the feaſt of Dedication</hi> inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Macchabees, and obſerued by Chriſt himſelfe, Ioh. 10. 22. So alſo did they conſecrate of theſe daies vnto the Lord by keeping their <hi>fasts</hi> vpon this day, as the Iſraelites kept a faſt in Miſpeh, 1. Sam. 7. And Heſt. 4. 16. there is a faſt kept of three daies long: yea <hi>Daniel</hi> keepes a faſt <hi>of three weekes of daies,</hi> Dan. 10. 3. Neither in ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is there any breach or alteration of Gods or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but rather an obſeruation. For as Chriſt brake not the commandement when he neglec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his dutie to parents to performe his dutie to God; ſo neither doe we breake this ordinance of God, when wee on any of the ſixe daies neglect our owne buſineſſe to ſerue God, the cauſe and neceſſitie ſo requiring: for if neceſſitie may cauſe
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:20637:112"/> vs to breake the Sabbath for the good of man; may not neceſſitie aſwell diſpenſe with our daies, and cauſe vs to ſanctifie a Sabbath for the good of man? Nay further, I take it that this comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement being a Synecdoche, and but a part put for the whole, (as are all the other commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) doth warrant; yea and commaund ſuch time conuenient in the weeke daies to be ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part vnto Gods ſeruice. And we ſee that Chriſt and the Apoſtles preached on theſe daies as well as vpon the Sabbath; which they would not haue done if it had been vnlawful for the people to heare. And as I thinke that any of theſe daies may by the Church be ſet apart to Gods ſeruice, the cauſe ſo requiring; ſo alſo doe I perſwade my ſelfe that ſome part of euery one of theſe daies ſhould be ſet apart to holy exerciſes, as morning and euening to pray with our families. And of theſe wee ſee <hi>Iſaac</hi> had one, hee went out in the euening to pray, Gen. 24. 63. <hi>Daniel</hi> had three, for he prayed three times a day, Dan. 6. 10. And <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> prayed ſeuen times a day, Pſal. 119. 164. And thus much as touching the ſecond queſtion, and ſo conſequently of the firſt reaſon to perſwade to the keeping of the Sabbath: for as for ſuch things as be here obſerued about the reſt, I haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them before in the diſcourſe of the reſt of the day.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He ſecond reaſon followeth, and is drawne from the end and inſtitution of the Sabbath, contained in theſe words; <hi>It is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God.</hi> And it may be thus gathered: If the Sabbath bee conſecrate vnto the Lord, and his worſhip, then you muſt reſt on it from your works: but the former is true; for it is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, and therfore it followeth that you muſt reſt from your works. And here marke with me, firſt the workmanſhip of this reaſon, how fitly it is framed: for firſt, leaſt any man ſhould bee ſo bold as to aske him for his commiſſion, as Exo. 2. one demaunded of <hi>Moſes; Who made thee a Iudge?</hi> or as Mat. 22. 23. the Prieſts demanded of Chriſt, <hi>By what authoritie doeſt thou theſe things?</hi> Therefore he ſhewes his authoritie, namely that he is autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie it ſelf, and he may command, for he is Lord, and no man will ſay vnto him (vnleſſe he be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell) <hi>What haſt thou to doe with vs?</hi> Matth. 8: for he hath to doe with vs, for he is thy Lord; and that diuers waies. Firſt, hee is thy Creator, hee made thee; and therefore looke how the veſſell is in the potters hand, ſo art thou in his, Rom. 9. This <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> knew well enough when he ſaid; <hi>Come let vs</hi>
                     <pb n="209" facs="tcp:20637:113"/> 
                     <hi>fall downe before the Lord our maker,</hi> Pſal. 95. 6. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, as he is thy Lord by creation, ſo alſo is he by redemption; <hi>He hath bought thee with a price,</hi> 1. Cor. 6. 20. a price <hi>not of gold and ſiluer, but with his moſt pretious bloud,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 18. And therefore this is rendred as a reaſon of his dying and riſing again, that he might be Lord ouer vs, Rom. 14. 9. Thirdly, as by his redemption, ſo by his ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigntie, rule and authoritie, in that he is abſolute in his commaund, and <hi>doth whatſoeuer he will both in heauen and in earth,</hi> Pſal. 115. 3. No man can ſtay his hand, neither dare any ſay vnto him, <hi>what doeſt thou?</hi> Dan. 4. 32. for he is <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> Rom. 17. 14. and <hi>his heſts ſtand like the lawes of the Medes and Perſians</hi> that cannot be recalled, Dan. 6. 12. Yea a degree further, he is the <hi>Lord of ſpirits,</hi> Num. 16. 22. and therefore will commaund not as other Lords, thy bodie onely, but thy ſoule too. Matth. 21. 37. <hi>Thou muſt ſerue him with all thy ſoule;</hi> and if it pleaſe him <hi>he can caſt both bodie and ſoule into hell fire,</hi> Mat. 10. 28. Now then if he be thy Lord and maſter in ſo full and ſo abſolute a manner; what then? why then, <hi>where is his feare?</hi> Malac. 1. 6. He calles for that, and good reaſon; for if there bee no maſter but will haue ſome ſeruice; ſhall God, ſo great a Lord and maſter, be without it? No, he will not, and therfore he here requireth it of thee on this day to ſerue him. Now there is one thing which the maſter oweth vnto the ſeruant, and that is protection, and euery man harpes vpon that ſtring; if he ſtands in need of his helpe, then <hi>Maſter ſaue vs, we periſh,</hi> Matth. 8. 25. But there is
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:20637:114"/> another thing that the ſeruant oweth to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and that is obedience; and there wee breake with him, <hi>He ſaith goe, and we goe not; come, and wee come not; doe this, and we doe it not;</hi> wee keepe his commandements with notes, as the Atheiſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leene the Articles of faith. But may it not be that there is cauſe, as that he is a hard man; or hee will not ſtand by his ſeruants to defend them; or elſe he giues not ſo good wages as others? Surely it is not ſo: for firſt <hi>Dauid</hi> tels vs, that <hi>he will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies chide, nor keepe his anger for euer,</hi> Pſal. 103. 8. Yea if he ſee vs <hi>once to fall downe before him, and to craue him to appeaſe his anger; he forgiues vs all,</hi> Mat. 18. 27. then he is no hard maſter. And as for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, he will ſuffer no man to doe vs wrong, but wil <hi>reproue eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> kings for our ſakes,</hi> Pſal. 105. 14. And as for his hire; there is no ſeruice like vnto his; no not the ſeruice of the King. You cannot ſay of him as <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid of <hi>Dauid;</hi> will he giue euery one of you fields and vineyards? will hee make you Captaines ouer thouſands, &amp;c? Yea he will, and more than that, <hi>he makes all his ſeruants Kings,</hi> Reu. 1. 6. and <hi>giues euery one of them a crowne of life,</hi> 2. Tim. 4. yea <hi>an euerlaſting kingdome, that withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not; reſerued in heauen,</hi> 1. Pet. 1. 4. All this hee giueth; and <hi>he giueth it liberally, not reproching and caſting men in the teeth with it,</hi> as <hi>Saul</hi> did his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers; why then what ſhall let vs to ſerue ſuch a maſter? Yet behold and wonder; let a flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring diuell a little intice vs, with a ſhew of any matter; or pleaſure of ſinne, though it be but for a ſeaſon; yet we are preſently in loue with it, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:20637:114"/> forſake our old Lord and maſter to ſerue him; like children, that though they haue good things in their hands, yet they will caſt them away for toyes and trifles; doth not God behold this? and is not this our ſin of diſobedience written euen with the point of a Diamond before him? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he will not forget it, neither ſhall it bee put out vntill we die, if we repent not, and learne to ſerue him better who is the Lord of all fleſh by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but by a more neere band, the Lord of his elect euen by redemption: and therefore much more to be ſerued by them.</p>
                  <p>And this is another motiue to moue vs to ſerue him: for though as a Lord he might onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund, and wee ought not therein to diſobey him; yet as a mercifull God in Chriſt, he had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perſwade; and to that end he vſeth an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawne from the couenant of grace that he hath made with man, in that he vouchſafeth <hi>to be called</hi> (to bee called doe I ſay) nay in that hee vouchſafeth indeed <hi>to be his God:</hi> for he ſaith not that it is <hi>the Sabbath of the Lord,</hi> but in a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſort he addeth <hi>thy God,</hi> pleading as it were thy poſſeſſion in him, and his intereſt in thee; and indeede in this the very bowels of Gods mercie and compaſſion are as it were wound vp, in that hee ſaith hee is <hi>thy God.</hi> And it containeth in it plenteous redemption; yea and aſſurance alſo. Hee is <hi>able</hi> to ſaue, <hi>for hee is God;</hi> and hee is <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> for he is <hi>a God vnto thee.</hi> Therefore hee calles himſelf <hi>thy God.</hi> Were he a Lord, a God, a Chriſt, a Ieſus; what is that to thee, if he be not thy God,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:20637:115"/> thy Lord, thy Chriſt, thy Ieſus? It would not much profit vs to know that meate is eaten an hundred miles off, if wee periſh for hunger. As little would it auaile vs to know that Chriſt is a God and a Sauiour, vnleſſe hee be thy Sauiour. And this is indeede the very marrow and honie combe of the word, to know that the promiſe is made vnto vs, and to our children, Act. 2. 39; that <hi>a childe is borne vnto vs,</hi> Iſai. 9. 6; that Chriſt is <hi>vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs wiſedome, and ſanctification, and redemption,</hi> 1. Cor. 1. 30; and that he died <hi>for our ſins,</hi> and roſe <hi>for our iuſtification,</hi> Rom. 4. 25; and here, that he is not aſhamed to be called <hi>thy God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the greatnes of a benefit can neuer be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, vnleſſe we conceiue firſt our great neede, and our great vnworthineſſe. And firſt for our baſeneſſe and vnworthineſſe, may wee not ſay as <hi>Dauid; Lord what is man, or the ſonne of man, that God ſhould be mindfull of him?</hi> Pſal. 8. that he ſhould vouchſafe to be called <hi>his God.</hi> Man is a <hi>very graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper of the earth,</hi> Iſai. 40. 22. yea all men together are but <hi>as a drop of water,</hi> and <hi>as the duſt of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi> Iſai. 40. 15. and as little goodneſſe haue wee as greatnes. The beſt is but <hi>as a brier,</hi> and the moſt righteous <hi>as a hedge of thornes,</hi> Mich. 7. 4. What were the Iſraelites themſelues? they were but brickmakers and pioners in Egypt; their foode was but <hi>onyons and garlicke;</hi> their worſhip but <hi>Idolatrie,</hi> Gen. 12. their father but <hi>an Amorite,</hi> their mother but <hi>an Hittite,</hi> Ezech. 16. 3: then what are wee, who in reſpect of them are but the wilde branches of the Oliue, and they the naturall? Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:20637:115"/> 11. verſ. 21. Now, as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>ſeemeth it a light thing vnto you to be the Kings ſonnes, ſeeing I am but a poore man and of ſmall reputation?</hi> So may we a thouſand times more iuſtly ſay in reſpect of the higheſt Maieſtie; <hi>Seemeth it a light thing vnto you that God ſhould vouchſafe to be called our God,</hi> ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are poore men and of no reputation? But this was not all; wee were not onely meane, but miſerable alſo: wee were <hi>by nature the children of wrath,</hi> Epheſ. 3. and the fire of Gods vengeance did burne againſt vs vnto the bottome of hell for our ſins. Yet then doth he ſtep in, and becomes vnto vs a ſauing God, by his bloud to clenſe vs from all our ſinnes. And not onely ſo, but in this that he vouchſafeth to be called <hi>our God,</hi> to giue vnto vs the aſſurance of the forgiuenes of our ſinnes, the aſſurance of the reſurrection of our bodies, the aſſurance of life euerlaſting; yea the aſſurance of all graces whatſoeuer. That all this is promiſed in theſe words, ſhall appeare: firſt, that it containeth in it the forgiuenes of ſinnes, appeareth in that <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith; <hi>The man is bleſſed whoſe God is the Lord,</hi> Pſalm. 33. 12. Now there is none <hi>bleſſed</hi> but <hi>he that hath his ſinnes forgiuen him,</hi> Pſal. 32. 1. And therfore he whoſe God is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lord hath his ſinnes forgiuen him. Secondly, as it containeth in it forgiuenes of ſinnes, ſo alſo doth it containe in it the promiſe of the reſurrection of the bodie.

                     <hi>dead, but of the liuing.</hi> The reaſon holdeth thus; whoſe God the Lord is, hee is their God by an euerlaſting couenant, and they ſhal liue for euer: but hee is the God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> therefore they ſhall liue for euer: and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently if he be thy God, thou ſhalt liue for euer. And that it containeth the promiſe of life euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in it, is manifeſt, Heb. 11. 16. <hi>God was not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to bee called their God: for hee had prepared for them an heauenly citie.</hi> The reaſon is thus conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; If he had not prepared for them a citie to come, he ſhould haue been aſhamed: but their God cannot be aſhamed, therefore he prepared a place for them; and ſo conſequently he will for thee, if hee bee thy God. In a word, in this one word <hi>thy God,</hi> are al the promiſes of God, <hi>Yea and Amen:</hi> for as the Apoſtle reaſoneth, <hi>He which gaue vs his ſonne, how ſhal he not with him giue vs al things alſo?</hi> Rom. 8. 32. And if God vouchſafe to giue vs himſelfe, how ſhall he not with himſelfe giue vs all things alſo? Let vs then ſeeke to make this ſure, that God is <hi>our God,</hi> and all things are ours, whether <hi>Paul;</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> or the world, or life, or things preſent, or things to come; euen all things are ours together with him, and that ſhall we know by this, if wee be his, 1. Cor. 2. vlt. And his wee are aſſuredly if his law be written in our inward parts, to doe it, then I ſay are we ſure that he is our God, and wee his people, Iere. 31. 33. So then to conclude this point; if in thy baſenes God aduanced thee; if in thy miſerie he relieued thee; if he forgiues thee thy ſinnes; aſſureth thee
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:20637:116"/> that thou ſhalt riſe againe vnto life; and liuing to giue thee euerlaſting life, and with it al happines, (all which he doth aſſure thee of, when he calleth himſelfe <hi>thy God)</hi> then I ſay keepe his Sabbath. For this hee requireth at thy hands, who is thy God, and hath done all theſe things for thee in becomming thy God. And thus much for the motiues that this reaſon containeth in it to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade vs to keepe his Sabbath.</p>

<pb n="217" facs="tcp:20637:117"/> That which I did for thine example, thou ough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt to doe the like: but I laboured ſixe daies and reſted the ſeuenth for thine example, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou muſt doe the like. So that the force of this reaſon ſtandeth in the example of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, the beſt preſident that the world or word it ſelfe can yeeld. Now of what force examples are, wee ſee in that men are lead by example, rather than by law, and hold it a good warrant for the doing of any thing for that others doe ſo: but if they be great ones that doe it, then it is put out of queſtion. For would ſuch men doe ſo, ſay they, if it were not lawfull? Now God ſeeing men ſo to be carried by example, and that this commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſo commonly broken by the example of great me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> eſpecially, who eſteeme of the Sabbath but as of another day; therefore he oppoſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their examples, his owne example, who is higher than the higheſt of them, whoſe breath is in their noſtrels: and his example alone is able to waigh downe all the examples or reaſons that can bee brought to the contrarie. And if a man will be lead by example, it is meete he ſhould be lead by the beſt example, and if it may be by ſuch an example that cannot erre. Now all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of men be they neuer ſo holy, haue much weaknes in them, and in one thing or other they miſſe. Let vs make proofe of ſome of the beſt of them. As for example, <hi>Salomon had a wiſe and an vnderſtanding heart, ſo that there was none like nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before nor after him,</hi> 1. King. 3. 12. a very high commendation; yet hee had his blemiſh, <hi>he loued</hi>
                     <pb n="218" facs="tcp:20637:118"/> 
                     <hi>outlandiſh women,</hi> 1. King. 10. 1. <hi>Aſa did right in the eyes of the Lord:</hi> but will you know his fault? <hi>he put not downe the high places,</hi> 1. King. 15. 14. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid was a man after Gods owne heart, that did what was right in the ſight of the Lord, and turned from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that he commanded all the daies of his life;</hi> yet in one thing he is chalenged, in <hi>the matter of Vriah the Hittite,</hi> 1. King. 15. 5. So then wee ſee the beſt men come ſhort, and, <hi>in many things wee ſinne all,</hi> I am. 3. 2. And therefore the beſt dare propoſe themſelues for examples to be followed no <hi>fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they follow Chriſt,</hi> 1. Cor. 12. 1. If a man be iuſt, another may be as iuſt as he; if a man be lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, another may bee as learned as he; if a man preach well, another may preach as well as he; if a man write well, another may write as well as he; and often we ſee the ſcholler to exceede the maſter. Now if theſe be the beſt examples we can propoſe vnto our ſelues, then the beſt come ſhort of that they ſhould be, and another man may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly doe as well as they, and ſo he may haue oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of boaſting: but God his example is an example propſed without example; it is ſo exact, ſo full, and ſo abſolute, that all the world cannot yeeld the like example; neither can a man take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny exception againſt it: and therefore this is an example aboue all to bee followed. And this his example hee ſo propoſeth here, as firſt ſetting it downe for a law, and then afterwards keeping the ſame law in his owne perſon: ſo that if either law or example will doe any thing with vs, hee would by both of them perſwade vs to keepe the
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20637:118"/> Sabbath Nay further, whereas in the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements, you ſhall not ſee the example of God obſerued in the keeping of them; yet in this one you may obſerue a double example giuen by God. For twice in the Scripture his keeping of the Sabbath is obſerued: firſt, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>when he created the heauens and earth, then hee rested the ſeuenth day.</hi> Secondly, <hi>when hee rained Manna in the wilderneſſe euery day, yet when the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath came he ceaſed.</hi> Exo. 16. 26. 27. Well then, hath the lawgiuer himſelfe gone before you in kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping this commaundement, let me then exhort you as the Apoſtle doth, Epheſ. 5. 1. <hi>Be you followers of God as deare children,</hi> and <hi>walke as ye haue him for an example.</hi> Now, louing children will followe their parents; then if you be children, I ſay if lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing children, you wil follow him. Now I know in generall that euery man will ſubſcribe vnto this, that they muſt follow God in keeping his Sabbath: but yet come and preſſe them to yeeld obedience in the particular duties, there you ſhal haue them as the young man in the Goſpell; <hi>they then depart ſorrowfull,</hi> that makes them to ſcratch where it doth not itch. What muſt they doe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but heare, pray, meditate? &amp;c. Nay, if it had been onely to forbeare the doing of ſome world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly buſineſſe, which they greatly cared not for the doing of at any time, they would haue forborne; but now vpon this day to forgo their afternoone ſports, and playes, and to ſit (as they terme it) mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping in a corner; this is too hard. Well, but I ſay, if you bee Gods children you will follow him;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:20637:119"/> yea and more than any ſonne imitateth the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for the father begetteth his ſonne but like vnto him in ſubſtance; but God begetteth his children like vnto him in qualities: <hi>They be holy as he is holy, mercifull as he is mercifull,</hi> and will imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate him in all his doings: and therefore in this they will keepe the Sabbath as he kept it; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they are no children but baſtards; I ſay ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtards on the mothers ſide, but not on the fathers; for were they his true children, they would be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo his deare children, as in this place, and would follow him.</p>

Not ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but I would haue them labour ſixe daies, and reſt the ſeuenth as God did. But that they may be the more fully anſwered, the workes which God hath wrought are of three ſorts. Whereof the firſt are ſuch as are miraculous, as <hi>to giue ſight vnto the blind, to faſt fourtie daies, to walk vpon the waters, to raiſe the dead, &amp;c.</hi> Now theſe are to bee wondred at, but not to be imitated; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the gift of working miracles ceaſeth in the Church, and it is a note of Antichriſt now to worke wonders, 2. Theſſ. 2. 9. The ſecond ſort of works are works of our redemption, as the ſonne of God <hi>to become the ſonne of man, to be borne of a virgin, to beare our ſinnes, to die for vs, to riſe againe and to aſcend into heauen.</hi> Now theſe are works to
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:20637:119"/> be beleeued, but not to be imitated, vnleſſe it bee in a certaine ſimilitude or reſemblance; that as Chriſt was conceiued and borne, ſo <hi>he ſhould bee conceiued and borne in vs,</hi> Gal. 4. 19. And as Chriſt died for ſinne, 1. Cor. 15. 3. <hi>ſo we ſhould die to ſinne,</hi> Rom. 6. 2. As Chriſt in his fleſh was crucified vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the croſſe; <hi>ſo ſhould we crucifie the fleſh with the luſts thereof,</hi> Galath. 4. 24. As Chriſt being dead for our ſinne was buried; ſo wee <hi>being dead to ſin, ſhould alſo be buried with him by baptiſme,</hi> Rom. 6. 4. As Chriſt being buried roſe againe; ſo muſt we being <hi>buried with him by baptiſme, riſe again to walke in newnes of life,</hi> verſ. 5. As Chriſt being riſen did aſcend; ſo muſt we riſen from the graue of ſinne aſcend, by <hi>ſetting our affections on things aboue,</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſ. 3. 2. And hereupon grew that rule, that <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer Chriſt did for vs, the ſame he did in vs.</hi> Laſtly, the third ſort of duties are morall duties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded in the law: and theſe are the workes wherein he is to bee imitated by vs. Examples whereof he giueth vs, Mat. 11. 29. Of meeknes, <hi>Learne of me that I am humble and meeke.</hi> In <hi>Iohn,</hi> of loue and brotherly kindnes, Ioh. 13. 15. <hi>I haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen you an example.</hi> And in this place of working ſixe daies, and reſting the ſeuenth. Indeede hee could haue finiſhed all his workes in one houre, or with a word ſpeaking; but hee would worke about them ſixe daies, and reſt the ſeuenth for our example. And therefore as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Haue you not read what Dauid did? how when hee was an hungred, &amp;c.</hi> So, <hi>haue you not read what the Lord did? how when he made the heauens and the earth, he</hi>

                     <hi>laboured ſixe daies and rested the ſeuenth:</hi> haue you not read it I ſay? if you haue, then againe I ſay, as Chriſt in another caſe, <hi>Goe and doe the like,</hi> Luk. 10. 37. that is, reſt, as he did.

The anſwere is, he alwaies worketh, and alwaies reſteth in himſelfe; but in this place he is ſaid to reſt or to worke in reſpect of his creatures. To reſt, I ſay, in that hee ceaſeth to make any more creatures; yet not to reſt from preſeruing them being made. For God was not idle on the ſeuenth day, but did ſuſtaine and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue the creatures which hee before had made; otherwiſe they would haue come to nothing. And therein wee are taught, that though on the Sabbath it bee not lawfull to labour to increaſe that wee haue; yet it is lawfull to ſaue and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue that we haue: and this he teacheth vs here by his owne example. And ſo much touching the ſenſe and force of theſe words.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>4</label> Now the vſe of theſe words is foure-fold. Firſt they ſerue to confute thoſe that ſtand ſo much vpon the examples of others; let a man demand of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> why they do ſo prophane the Lords day by their vnlawful games &amp; ſports; by their riding and running abroad in errands; by their trudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and poſting to Faires and Markets: they will anſwere, <hi>they doe but as others doe,</hi> and <hi>they that are</hi>
                     <pb n="223" facs="tcp:20637:120"/> 
                     <hi>better men, and haue more knowledge than they, do ſo;</hi> and, <hi>if it were not lawfull they would not doe it; would ſuch a Iuſtice, or ſuch a Preacher bowle or banquet, or ride about vpon the Sabbath, if it were not lawfull?</hi> And when they haue thus anſwered, they thinke they haue ſpoken to the matter paſſing well. But I wonder, ſeeing they will bee lead by example, why they doe not looke vnto God, and follow his example, which is the beſt of all: for I am ſure that there is none of thoſe which they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low is worthie to bee named the ſame day with him; none ſo learned, none of ſuch authoritie as he: may not a man then returne this their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vpon them, when they ſhall ſay, ſuch and ſuch that are learned, and of authoritie do breake the Sabbath? may not wee anſwere them, I ſay, and that iuſtly that their betters doe keepe it; and that therefore they ſhould keep it? <hi>Dauid</hi> kept it, the Prophets kept it, the Apoſtles kept it, Chriſt himſelfe kept it, when hee was here in the fleſh; nay God kept it, as here we ſee. Now if they can bring examples for the prophaning of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath greater and better than theſe, let them ſhew them: but certaine it is they cannot; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hence foorth let them be aſhamed thus to reaſon; and to offer that meaſure vnto God, which they would diſaine their ſeruant ſhould offer vnto them. For let the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> anſwer me in the like caſe; would they be contented, if ſending their ſeruants in their buſineſſe, their ſeruants ſhould neglect the doing of that wherein they were imployed, and ſpend the time at cards or dice, or
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:20637:121"/> dauncing, or ſeruing their owne turnes; would they (I ſay) be contented? if when they ſhould expoſtulate the matter with them, they ſhould anſwere, that they did not play alone; but others did play aſwell as they. Or if thou ſhouldeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue thy child for ſwearing, or lying vnto thee, wouldeſt thou take it well that he ſhould anſwer; others lie and ſweare as well as I? But thou art too cockering of thy childe: I propoſe therefore another caſe; If a theefe ſhould anſwere a Iudge thus, that others did ſteale as well as hee; would not the Iudge replie, that therefore he ſhould be hanged for example vnto others. And how is it then that wee thinke ſo baſely of God, as that the example of ſuch prophane men (for ſo I may iuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terme them that prophane Gods Sabbath) ſhould bee able to match, yea and ouermatch the example of God himſelfe with theſe men.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this alſo ſerueth for our comfort, that when others ſhall vpbraide vs as preciſe and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, for that we will not doe vpon the Sabbath as others of our neighbours doe, as to goe to bowles with them, or cards, or to dauncing, or ſuch like vaine ſports; I ſay, when wee ſhall be thus vpbraided, yet here is our comfort, wee are not alone in this, but God is with vs, and he hath troden the way before vs in his owne perſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting vpon the Sabbath, that wee might doe the like.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, in that God wrought ſixe daies and reſted the ſeuenth, to teach vs to doe the like, we are thence to learne this inſtruction, that the end
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:20637:121"/> of our doings muſt not bee our ſelues alone, but we muſt haue regard of others alſo, that they by our good example may be moued to well doing, Mat. 5. 16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good workes.</hi> And for this cauſe it was that Chriſt payed tribute, though hee were free. And for the example of others it was, that hee went to heare <hi>Iohn,</hi> he had no neede to be taught of any, for the ſpirit was giuen him aboue mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: yet he would goe heare <hi>Iohn,</hi> to giue an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample vnto vs to imbrace the gifts and graces of God in our inferiours. But of this ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly and laſtly, in that God within the compaſſe of ſixe daies was able of nothing to create the heauens, and the earth, and all things that are in them contained; we may learne that God is able in a ſhort time to bring wonderfull things to paſſe. When wee reade the acts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander,</hi> wee wonder to ſee how that in a ſhort time hee did ſubdue the greateſt part of the world: but what was that to this? it is eaſier by farre to pull downe and to deſtroy, than to build vp; to take away life, than to giue. And therefore that God ſhould ſo ſoone of nothing make a world, how great was this his power? The Iewes thought it an incredible thing that Chriſt ſhould ſay, <hi>he would reare the Temple in three daies,</hi> that was a building ſixe and fourtie yeeres; they miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood him I know: but if he had ſaid it of the materiall Temple, it had been nothing to this, to the frame and workmanſhip of the world; the Temple was but as the rearing of a molhill, in
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:20637:122"/> compariſon of the greateſt mountaine in the world. Yet ſee how ſoon he diſpatches this great work, in ſixe daies he diſpatches the whole frame, though hee had not any matter wherewithall to begin to build: So true is that in the Pſalm. 115. 3. <hi>he doth whatſoeuer he will.</hi> And therfore it skils not how difficult the worke be, ſo he be the builder; how troubleſome the ſeas, ſo hee bee the Pilot; how doubtful the conqueſt, ſo he be the Leader; nor how dangerous the ſicknes, ſo he be the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. And as he is powerfull in ſauing, ſo is hee alſo in deſtroying, it being as eaſie a thing: and therefore let his enemies looke vnto the rod of his power, who is able at an inſtant to deſtroy them all. At an inſtant he diſgards <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> and turnes him out of his palace. At an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant he ſmites all the firſt borne in Egypt. At an inſtant hee ouerwhelmes <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his hoſt, rendeth tenne Tribes from <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> ouerturneth Sodome, maketh a world, drowneth a world, and ſaueth a world againe. What ſhall I ſay more? as he knoweth all things, ſo hee can doe all things, both in heauen and in earth, in which he hath all meanes to ſerue his turne: the very Angels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues are his <hi>miniſtring ſpirits,</hi> Pſal. 104. 4. and the diuels cannot goe <hi>without his leaue,</hi> Mat. 8. 32. And as for men he commaunds them much more, for <hi>he is the Lord of hoſts,</hi> Iſai. 1. And he hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly theſe of men and none other hoſts, but <hi>he hath armies of frogges and flyes and lice</hi> to fight againſt his enemies, Exod. 8. When he will, the heauens ſhell take his part, 1. Sam. 7. and the Sunne ſhall
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:20637:122"/> ſtay his courſe till he be auenged of his enemies. So then he hath all meanes at his command. And were it ſo that hee had but ſmall meanes, yet hee can make it ſerue and hold out. If hee ſay the word, <hi>the meale in the barrell ſhall not waſte, neither ſhall the oyle in the cruce diminiſh,</hi> 1. King. 17. 14. If he will haue it ſo, <hi>one ſuite of apparell ſhall laſt fourtie yeeres, and yet ſhall not waxe old. With fiue loaues hee will feede fiue thouſand men,</hi> Matth. 14. Were it ſo that meanes ſhould faile, yet he can worke with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them as well as with them. <hi>Aſa</hi> had ſaid little if he had ſaid it had bin <hi>all one to God to ſaue by few as by many,</hi> if he had not added, <hi>or by none,</hi> 2. Chro. 14. 10. For hee is not tyed vnto the meanes, as a Carpenter is vnto his tooles; but hee can worke aſwell without them as with them. For when there was no raine, yet hee made the earth fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, Gen. 2. 5. when there was no Sunne to ſhine, yet there was light. Then God can worke we ſee without meanes; and ſo hee can againſt meanes. Who would not thinke that clay put in a mans eyes ſhould put out a mans eyes? yet <hi>tempering it he giueth ſight thereby,</hi> Ioh. 9. 6. Who would not thinke that if a man ſhould ſtrike a rocke, that he ſhould rather make fire come out of it, than wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? yet <hi>he ſtrikes the rocke and the waters flow,</hi> Exo. 17. 6. Who would not thinke that Colloquinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da ſhould rather poyſon a man, than be health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meate for him? yet he bleſſing it, <hi>there is no euill in it,</hi> 2. King. 4. 40, 41. Who would not think that the fire ſhould not burne? yet the three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren put into the fornace were not only not bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:20637:123"/> but had not ſo much as any ſmell of fire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them, Dan. 3. This therefore hath this vſe, to comfort vs, that when comfort ſhall ſeeme to ſtand a farre off, like <hi>Abraham</hi> in the heauens, yet we be not diſmaied; for God is ſtronger than the Duiell: and therefore though wee be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, yet wee may be ſtill: comfort is on foote, and in the middeſt of them we ſhall finde helpe; in the middeſt of the wilderneſſe we ſhall finde water, as the Iſraelites; in the Lions belly an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny combe, as <hi>Sampſon;</hi> in the priſon an Angell, as <hi>Peter;</hi> and in the middeſt of the fire, one like the Sonne of God, as the three children. And ſo much for the third reaſon.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow followeth the laſt reaſon to bee diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed in theſe wordes: <hi>Therefore the Lord bleſſed and hallowed the Sabbath day.</hi> In which let vs firſt ſee what is meant by <hi>bleſsing and hallowing:</hi> which two words that I may ſpeak of them to our purpoſe, haue a double ſenſe and vnderſtanding in the Scripture. For firſt, <hi>bleſsing</hi> is vſed to ſignifie <hi>the ſetting apart of ſome thing to a holy vſe,</hi> in which ſenſe the wine in the Lords Supper is called <hi>the cup of bleſsing,</hi> when it is ſet
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:20637:123"/> apart to that holy vſe; and the ſetting of it apart to that vſe is called <hi>the bleſsing of it,</hi> as 1. Cor. 10. ver. 16. <hi>The cup of bleſsing which we bleſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And to the ſame purpoſe alſo is this word <hi>ſanctifying</hi> or <hi>hallowing</hi> vſed, as Exod. 13. 1. <hi>Sanctifie to me the firſt borne that openeth the wombe:</hi> that is, <hi>ſet apart to my ſeruice.</hi> This is plaine, I neede not to ſhew it further. The ſecond ſenſe of bleſſing or hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, when as ſome gift is beſtowed vpon any one, hee is ſaid therein to be <hi>bleſſed,</hi> and ſo gifts are called <hi>bleſsings,</hi> Gen. 33. 11. <hi>I pray thee</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> to his brother) <hi>take this bleſsing,</hi> that is, this gift. And Iudg. 1. the daughter of <hi>Caleb</hi> prayed hir father to to giue her <hi>a bleſsing;</hi> and what was that? <hi>ſprings of water,</hi> Iudg. 1. 15. The ſame ſenſe alſo hath <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> when God ſhal beſtow ſome gift of ſanctification vpon vs that day. Now both theſe waies God doth bleſſe or hallow this day: firſt <hi>in inſtituting this day vnto his ſeruice.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that <hi>in this his ſeruice he doth effectually bleſſe vs;</hi> vs, I ſay, and not the day: for all daies in their owne nature are alike, and not one more holie than another, more than in regard of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that it is ſet a part to holie vſes, or of the bleſſing that is this day beſtowed vpon vs aboue any other. Now God doth conſecrate it in the firſt reſpect; and wee muſt in the other, that the bleſſing may bee vpon vs: but take it in which ſenſe you will, yet it ſtandeth as a ſtrong argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to perſwade. And if in the firſt ſenſe, then it is thus gathered: To what end God did bleſſe and hallow this reſt, to that end it muſt be kept:
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:20637:124"/> but God did therfore bleſſe and hallow this day that it might be kept holy: and therefore ſo it muſt be kept holy.</p>
                  <p>The equitie of this reaſon is grounded vpon the right and authoritie that God hath to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund or inſtitute any law; which if he doe, it is like vnto the lawes of the Medes and Perſians, which cannot be altered but by himſelfe: for, <hi>thou muſt put nothing to his word,</hi> Deut. 12. 31. The reaſon is, Pro. 30. 6. <hi>Leaſt he reproue thee, and thou be found a lier: neither muſt thou take any thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from:</hi> there muſt be no clipping. The reaſon alſo is yeelded, Deut. 4. 2. <hi>That thou maiſt keepe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement;</hi> which thou canſt not doe, if thou take any thing there from: and as thou maiſt not adde, ſo thou muſt not alter; but thou muſt keep his Sabbath as he commandeth, Deut. 5. 16. Yea thou maiſt not ſo much as varie from it; for <hi>thou muſt turne neither to the right hand, nor to the left:</hi> the reaſon that is giuen is drawne from the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit that comes thereby, namely <hi>that thou maiſt proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> Ioſ. 1. 7. As who ſhould ſay, if thou turne ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the right hand, or to the left, thou ſhalt not proſper; but if thou keepe it and turne not aſide, then thou ſhalt proſper; for he will bleſſe thee, as here thou ſeeſt. For this is the ſecond ſignifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bleſſing or hallowing, and is the thing that God eſpecially here intendeth, to ſhew, namely that hee will powre foorth his bleſſing vpon thoſe that keep his Sabbath. And that bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing he moſt fully promiſeth, Iſai. 58. <hi>If thou wilt turne away thy foote from the Sabbath, not doing thine</hi>
                     <pb n="231" facs="tcp:20637:124"/> 
                     <hi>owne waies, nor ſeeking thine owne will, nor ſpeaking a vaine word;</hi> theſe three things on the Sabbath muſt bee auoided: but what followeth to bee done? Firſt, we muſt <hi>call the Sabbath a delight.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, wee muſt <hi>conſecrate it as glorious vnto the Lord.</hi> And thirdly, we muſt <hi>honour him vpon that day.</hi> But then what ſhall they haue that thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Lord? Why God will honour them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and make them to mount vpon the high places of the earth; and like a tree planted by the waters ſide ſhall they proſper: and not onely ſo, that they ſhall be bleſſed with worldly bleſſings, which might perſwade worldly men; but much more with ſpirituall bleſſings (which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade Chriſtian men) he will <hi>feede them with the heritage of Iacob:</hi> as if hee ſhould haue ſaid; they ſhall enioy all the priuiledges of his Church; loe thus ſhall the man bee bleſſed that ſhall keepe his Sabbath. And therefore Iſai. 56. 3. <hi>Let no man that keepeth the Sabbath ſay, The Lord hath ſeparated me from his people.</hi> Why ſo? <hi>For he will feede them with the heritage of Iacob,</hi> as now you haue heard; <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let the Eunuch ſay, Behold I am a drie tree.</hi> No, for <hi>if he keepe his Sabbath, and chuſe the thing that is good, and take heede of his couenant, he ſhall mount vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the high places of the earth;</hi> as there he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Yea, and as it followeth; <hi>he will giue him a place in his houſe, and a name better than of ſonnes and daughters.</hi> But can all this be true? Yea certainly make account of it, for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it, Iſai. 58. 14.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">§. Sect. </seg>2</label> Now, the vſe of this is two-fold. Firſt, it nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blie
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:20637:125"/> meeteth with the error of the multitude, that thinke if a man ſerue God, he ſhall neuer thriue; as though God were like an euill maſter that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to reward him worſt that doth him the beſt ſeruice. But theſe blinde bayards that thus beate their heads againſt the wall, little think vpon this that God here promiſeth, that thoſe which keepe his Sabbath ſhall bee bleſſed; if they did, they would neuer goe ſtumbling on. But to the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the Sabbath this is a moſt ſure word, that if a man keepe it, the Lord will make him to mount vpon the high places of the earth, and wil feede them with the heritage of <hi>Iacob.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by this a man ſhall know when hee is at the ſermon how well he thriueth at home: for if he truly ſerue the Lord in the Church, God will truly bleſſe him at home; for hee hath promiſed it, and hee cannot goe from his word, no more than hee can denie himſelfe: happely hee may ſometimes denie ſome worldly bleſſings, when he ſeeth it not good for thee to haue it; but then aſſure thy ſelfe he will giue thee that which is ten times better; and that thou ſhalt in this life finde and aſſuredly know. And therefore thinke not that if thou loſe an houre, or a day, that thou ſhalt be vndone; but waite vpon the Lord, for <hi>it is his bleſsing that maketh rich,</hi> and not thy labour. And if he bleſſed the Manna that was gathered on the ſixt day, that it ſhould be enough for the ſeuenth alſo: and if he made the earth in the ſixth yeere to bring forth food ſufficient for two yeeres, Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit. 25; why ſhouldeſt thou diſtruſt his bountie
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:20637:125"/> towards thee? Therefore <hi>caſt thy care vpon him;</hi> for if thou wilt keepe his Sabbath, <hi>he will care for thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond vſe is to informe the Sabbath brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of their eſtate in which they ſtand; (and I would to God they would take notice of it) that they are in a curſed eſtate: for if the Sabbath keepers be bleſſed; then the Sabbath breakers by the law of contraries muſt bee accurſed. And ſo they are indeede. And <hi>Nehemiah</hi> is not afraide to tell them ſo much to their faces: <hi>Did not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your fathers thus?</hi> (that is, breake the Sabbath) <hi>and did not God therefore bring all theſe plagues vpon vs? and will you yet increaſe the wrath vpon Iſrael in breaking the Sabbath?</hi> Nehe. 13. And as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> told them what they had alreadie felt; ſo Ier. 17. vlt. tels them what they ſhall further looke for; <hi>If</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you will not heare me, to ſanctifie the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and to beare no burthen;</hi> What then? <hi>then the Lord will kindle a fire in the gates of Ieruſalem.</hi> Yea but it ſhall not come into the high ſtreetes. Yes, (ſaith he) for <hi>it ſhall deuoure the palaces thereof.</hi> But we will quench it firſt before it goe ſo farre. Nay (ſaith he) <hi>it ſhall not be quenched;</hi> as though the fire thereof ſhould burne like wilde fire, or rather like hell fire that is vnquenchable, Mat. 3. And of this there is good reaſon. For if for the neglect of the building of the Lords houſe, the Lord curſed his people, ſo that <hi>when they ſowed much, they brought in little; that when they eate, they were not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; when they dranke, their thirſt remained, &amp;c.</hi> If (I ſay) the Lord curſed them thus for the neglect
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:20637:126"/> of the building of the materiall Temple; what will he doe for the neglect of the building of the ſpirituall Temple? which is certainly neglected where as the Sabbath is neglected. And although happely it ſometimes come to paſſe that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath breaker may proſper in worldly matters, yet they are but <hi>bleſsings of Gods left hand,</hi> Prou. 3. 16. which many times hee giues <hi>to the ruine of the ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thereof,</hi> Eccl. 5. 12. He giueth them <hi>as he gaue a King to the Iſraelites in his anger, and in his wrath he takes them away againe.</hi> But how ſoeuer, this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that though he giues them their hearts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, yet with the gift <hi>he ſendeth leanneſſe into their ſoules,</hi> as Pſal. 106. 15. and they ſhall finde one day the euill of their riches, when they ſhall weepe and howle for the miſeries that ſhall come vpon them; when I ſay their conſciences ſhall crie out againſt them, Wee haue gotten this money by breaking the Lords Sabbath, and when the ruſt of the ſame ſhall teſtifie ſo much againſt them; then ſhall they finde that true which euen now I cited, that their riches was giuen them for their euill.</p>

And herein I haue ſhewed firſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie of the Sabbath. Secondly, the change of the time of the Sabbath. Thirdly, that it may not againe be changed. Fourthly, that the whole day muſt bee kept; and this in the firſt booke. In the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:20637:126"/> ſecond I haue ſhewed the duties of this day; which conſiſt firſt in preparation to the Sabbath. Secondly in obſeruation, which contained two things: firſt, to reſt vpon it when it is come, from all workes, words or thoughts that might be a let to the performance of the holy duties that were required of vs; which duties were of three ſorts, either publique, or priuate, or mixt: and this was the ſumme of the ſecond booke. In the third I haue ſhewed the perſons to whom theſe duties doe appertaine; which were either vnto vs, or thoſe that were vnder our gouernment. And laſt of al in the fourth, the reaſons that might inforce vs to the keeping of this day holy; that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, is, that euery one of vs in regard of the time paſt, fall downe before the Lord in the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and acknowledgement of this great ſinne of Sabbath breaking, and that with purpoſe of heart hence-foorth wee endeuour with all our might, both in our owne perſons, and by all meanes we may, to prouoke others alſo to keepe the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath with vs: and then ſhall the Lord euen our God aſſuredly bleſſe vs, with the riches of his mercies reſerued from euerlaſting in heauen for vs; which the Lord graunt vnto vs for Chriſt his ſake. <hi>Amen.</hi>
